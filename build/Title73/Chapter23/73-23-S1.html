The Legislature finds that the level of the Great Salt Lake has risen sharply in recent years due to extreme weather conditions.  The high level of the lake has caused extraordinary flooding conditions resulting in substantial damage to public and private facilities.  Those conditions pose a threat to life, health, and property, and in particular may result in extensive damage to public lands, major transportation routes, and other public facilities.</td>
