Production shall be allocated in proportion to the relative value that each tract bears to the value of all tracts in the unit area.  The acreage of each tract in proportion to the total unit acreage shall be the measure of relative value, unless the division finds after public hearing that another method is likely to result in a more equitable allocation and protection of correlative rights.  Resource temperature, pressure, fluid quality, geological conditions, distance to place of use, and productivity are among the factors that may be considered in evaluating other methods.  The method for allocating production in unit operations shall be revised, if, after a hearing, the division finds that the revised method is likely to result in a more equitable allocation and protection of correlative rights.  Any affected person may file a request for agency action to consider adoption of a revised allocation method, but the request may not be made until three years after the initial order by the division or at less than two-year intervals after that.  Upon receipt of a request for consideration of a revised allocation method, the division shall hold a hearing;</td>
