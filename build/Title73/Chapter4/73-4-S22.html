Upon the service of this summons on you, you will thereafter be subject to the jurisdiction of the entitled court and, if you have or intend to claim a water right, it shall be your duty to follow further proceedings in the above entitled action and to defend and protect your water rights therein. If you have not been served with summons other than by publication in a newspaper and you claim a water right for which you have not previously filed a statement of claim, you must file a statement of claim in accordance with Section <a href="../../Title73/Chapter4/73-4-S5.html?v=C73-4-S5_2018050820180508">73-4-5</a> in this action setting forth the nature of your claim within 90 days after the last date of publication of this summons.
