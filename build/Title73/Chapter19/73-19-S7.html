<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">ARTICLE VII -- APPORTIONMENT OF WATER AND RELATED MATTERS</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  So far as the states are concerned, all waters of the Columbia River System shall be available for appropriation for beneficial purposes under and to the extent permitted by the laws of the states involved, but, except for the provisions in this subdivision A relating to certain relationships between consumptive and nonconsumptive uses, no apportionment of waters or determination of rights to the use thereof is made by this compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far as the states are concerned, rights to beneficial consumptive uses of water within the upstream area, whether established heretofore or hereafter under the laws of the states involved, shall be recognized up to the average annual depletions shown in Plate 7 of the Report of the North Pacific Division, U.S. Army Engineers dated 1 June 1958, as against, and shall not be limited by, any rights, existing or future, to the quantity of such waters for nonconsumptive uses.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of a stream situated wholly within a downstream state and tributary to the Snake River or to the Columbia River, however, the relationship as between nonconsumptive use rights appurtenant to a development located thereon and consumptive use rights as to the waters of such a tributary upstream from that development shall be governed by the laws of that state without regard to the foregoing limitations of this subdivision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  No waters of the Columbia River System shall be diverted out of the Columbia River Basin for use for any purpose except with the approval of all of the member states, but this provision shall not affect rights so to divert which are existing on the effective date of this compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  The member states hereby designate, appoint and empower their commissioners to draft, negotiate and propose any and all compacts apportioning waters of any tributary stream forming part of the Columbia River System among or between the states through which said tributary stream flows, or amendments to this compact. Any such supplementary compacts or amendments to this compact negotiated as herein provided shall become effective upon approval by the commission, ratification by the legislatures of the member states party thereto, and consent thereto by the Congress.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.  All interstate compacts affecting the waters of the Columbia River System which are in effect as of the date this compact becomes operative shall remain unaffected hereby.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.  In the event this compact is terminated, any right to the beneficial consumptive use of water which, prior to the date of termination, is required to be recognized under the provisions of this compact shall continue to be recognized after such termination to the extent herein provided. Unless otherwise expressly provided in a supplemental compact, made pursuant to the provisions of subdivision C of this article, no such right required to be recognized as of the effective date of such supplement shall be impaired by such supplemental compact.<br>
<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">ARTICLE VIII -- POLLUTION CONTROL</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  The states and the United States recognize that the rapid increase of the population of the Columbia River Basin and the growth of industrial, mining, and related activities within that area can lead to such pollution of the waters of the Columbia River System as might constitute a menace to the health and welfare of the people. The states and the United States further recognize that maintenance and improvement of the quality of the waters of the Columbia River System require co-operative action and that pollution abatement and control are essential to the proper realization of the objectives of this compact and to the safe, profitable, and efficient multi-purpose use of the waters of said Columbia River System.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  In addition to the powers enumerated in article V, it shall be the duty of the commission and the commission shall have power:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  To engage in such investigations, analyses or other appropriate means as are deemed necessary to obtain, co-ordinate, tabulate and summarize technical and other data on the pollution of the waters of the Columbia River System or any portion thereof and on the character and condition of such waters and the needs of the Columbia River Basin for improved water quality; and to prepare reports thereon at such times as may be deemed advisable by the commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  To co-operate with governments or agencies thereof or other entities for the purpose of promoting uniform laws, rules or regulations for the abatement and control of pollution of the waters of the Columbia River System or any portion thereof, and to make, revise and recommend to the governments water quality objectives necessary to protect the public health, public water supplies, propagation of fish and aquatic life and wildlife, recreational purposes, and agricultural, industrial and other uses.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)  To disseminate to the public, by any and all appropriate means, information respecting pollution abatement and control in the waters of the Columbia River System or any portion thereof and on the harmful and uneconomic results of such pollution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  Each state shall have the primary obligation and responsibility to take appropriate action under its own laws to abate and control interstate pollution, which is defined as the deterioration of the quality of the waters of the Columbia River Basin within the boundaries of such state which materially and adversely affects beneficial uses of waters of the Columbia River Basin in other states. Upon complaint to the commission by the state water pollution control agency of one state that interstate pollution originating in another state or states is not being prevented or abated, the procedure shall be as follows:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  The commission shall call a hearing, giving not less than 30 days notice in writing thereof to the water pollution control agencies of the states involved and to each person or entity which the commission finds is charged with causing such interstate pollution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  Such hearing shall be held in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)  At the conclusion of such hearing, the commission shall make a finding as to whether interstate pollution exists, and if so, shall recommend to the appropriate agency that action be taken under state or federal law to abate or correct such interstate pollution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.  The water pollution control agencies of the member states shall from time to time, make available to the commission all data relating to the quality of the waters of the Columbia River Basin which they possess as the result of studies, surveys and investigations thereof which they may have made.<br>
