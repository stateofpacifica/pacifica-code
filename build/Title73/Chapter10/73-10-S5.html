<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a project to be constructed with money made available from the funds created by Section <a href="../../Title73/Chapter10/73-10-S8.html?v=C73-10-S8_1800010118000101">73-10-8</a> has been selected by the board, which in its opinion, will conserve the water resources of this state for the best interests of the citizens of the state, the board shall cause plans and cost estimates of such project to be prepared. Such plans and cost estimates shall then be referred to the director of the Division of Finance who shall determine whether or not funds are available for the construction of the project. If the director of the Division of Finance approves the project so far as the availability of funds is concerned, the Utah water and power board shall then enter into a contract or contracts for the construction of the project. Such contracts shall not be binding upon the state until approved by the director of the Division of Finance from the standpoint of whether or not the cost of the work is reasonable and whether the contract has been entered into under the terms and conditions most advantageous to the state.
