In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires "contract" and "agreement" are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. "Contract for sale" includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A "sale" consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section <a href="../../Title70A/Chapter2/70A-2-S401.html?v=C70A-2-S401_1800010118000101">70A-2-401</a>). A "present sale" means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the contract.</td>

"Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.</td>
