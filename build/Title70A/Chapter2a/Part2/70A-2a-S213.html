          </b><b>Implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except in a finance lease, if the lessor at the time the lease contract is made has reason to know of any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the lessee is relying on the lessor's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is in the lease contract an implied warranty that the goods will be fit for that purpose.
