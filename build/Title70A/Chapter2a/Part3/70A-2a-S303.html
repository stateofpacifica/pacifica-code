A transfer of "the lease" or of "all my rights under the lease" or a transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights, and unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee.  Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by  the transferee to perform those duties.   The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.</td>
