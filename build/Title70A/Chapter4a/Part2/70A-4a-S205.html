This subsection applies if the sender of an erroneous payment order described in Subsection <a href="#70A-4a-205(1)">(1)</a> is not obliged to pay all or part of the order, and the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order.

If the bank proves that the sender failed to perform that duty, the sender is obliged to reimburse the bank for the loss the bank proves it incurred as a result of the failure, but the liability of the sender may not exceed the amount of the sender's order.</td>
