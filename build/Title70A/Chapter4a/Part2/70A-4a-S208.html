If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons.  The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank.

If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by Subsection <a href="#70A-4a-208(2)(a)">(2)(a)</a>, as though the sender were a bank.  Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence.  The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.</td>
