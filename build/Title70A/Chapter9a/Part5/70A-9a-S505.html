A consignor, lessor, or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in Subsection <a href="../../Title70A/Chapter9A/70A-9a-S311.html?v=C70A-9a-S311_1800010118000101#70A-9a-311(1)">70A-9a-311(1)</a>, using the terms "consignor," "consignee," "lessor," "lessee," "bailor," "bailee," "licensor," "licensee," "owner," "registered owner," "buyer," "seller," or words of similar import, instead of the terms "secured party" and "debtor."</td>

This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under Subsection <a href="#70A-9a-505(1)">(1)</a> and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under Subsection <a href="../../Title70A/Chapter9A/70A-9a-S311.html?v=C70A-9a-S311_1800010118000101#70A-9a-311(2)">70A-9a-311(2)</a>, but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation.  If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.</td>
