          </b><b>Subordinated obligations.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated.  Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor.
