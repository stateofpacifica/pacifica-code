The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments.  An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.  An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by the issuer or acceptor of the instrument, or a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a copayee.</td>
