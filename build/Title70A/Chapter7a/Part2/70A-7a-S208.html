          </b><b>Altered warehouse receipts.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a blank in a negotiable tangible warehouse receipt has been filled in without authority, a good-faith purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of authority may treat the insertion as authorized.  Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any tangible or electronic warehouse receipt enforceable against the issuer according to its original tenor.
