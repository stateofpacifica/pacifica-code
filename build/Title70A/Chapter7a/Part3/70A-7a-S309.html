A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall exercise the degree of care in relation to the goods which a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances.  This Subsection <a href="#70A-7a-309(1)">(1)</a> does not affect any statute, regulation, or rule of law that imposes liability upon a common carrier for damages not caused by its negligence.</td>

Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation agreement that the carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation agreement if the carrier's rates are dependent upon value and the consignor is afforded an opportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity.  However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion to its own use.</td>
