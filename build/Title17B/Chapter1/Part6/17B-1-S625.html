If any balance held in a trust fund for a specific purpose, other than a cemetery perpetual care trust fund, is to be transferred because its original purpose or restriction has ceased to exist, a public hearing shall be held in the manner provided in Sections <a href="../../Title17B/Chapter1/17B-1-S609.html?v=C17B-1-S609_2015051220150512">17B-1-609</a> and <a href="../../Title17B/Chapter1/17B-1-S610.html?v=C17B-1-S610_1800010118000101">17B-1-610</a>. The published notice shall invite those persons who contributed to the fund to appear at the hearing.  If the board of trustees determines the fund balance amounts are refundable to the original contributors, a 30-day period following the hearing shall be allowed for persons having an interest in the fund to file with the board of trustees a verified claim only for the amount of each claimant's contributions.  Any claim not so filed shall be barred.  Any balance remaining, after refunds to eligible contributors, shall be transferred to the fund balance account in the general fund of the district.</td>
