In IBC, Section 703, a new section is added as follows: "703.8 Determination of non-combustible protection time contribution. The time, in minutes, contributed to the fire-resistance rating by the non-combustible protection of mass timber building elements, components, or assemblies, shall be established through a comparison of assemblies tested using procedures set forth in ASTM E119 or UL263. The test assemblies shall be identical in construction, loading, and materials, other than the non-combustible protection. The two test assemblies shall be tested to the same criteria of structural failure.
