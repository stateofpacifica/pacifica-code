In IPC, Section 312.3, the following is added at the end of the paragraph:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where water is not available at the construction site or where freezing conditions limit the use of water on the construction site, plastic drainage and vent pipe may be permitted to be tested with air.  The following procedures shall be followed:<br>1.  Contractor shall recognize that plastic is extremely brittle at lower temperatures and can explode, causing serious injury or death.<br>2.  Contractor assumes all liability for injury or death to persons or damage to property or for claims for labor and/or material arising from any alleged failure of the system during testing with air or compressed gasses.<br>3.  Proper personal protective equipment, including safety eyewear and protective headgear, should be worn by all individuals in any area where an air or gas test is being conducted.<br>4.  Contractor shall take all precautions necessary to limit the pressure within the plastic piping.<br>5.  No drain and vent system shall be pressurized in excess of 6 psi as measured by accurate gauges graduated to no more than three times the test pressure.<br>6.  The pressure gauge shall be monitored during the test period, which should not exceed 15 minutes.<br>7.  At the conclusion of the test, the system shall be depressurized gradually, all trapped air or gases should be vented, and test balls and plugs should be removed with caution."</td>
