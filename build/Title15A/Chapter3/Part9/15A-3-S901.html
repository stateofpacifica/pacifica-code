Egress windows.  The home has at least one egress window in each bedroom, or a window that meets the minimum specifications of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Manufactured Homes Construction and Safety Standards (MHCSS) program as set forth in 24 C.F.R. Parts 3280 and 3282, MHCSS 3280.106 and 3280.404 for manufactured homes.  These standards require the window to be at least 22 inches in the horizontal or vertical position in its least dimension and at least five square feet in area.  The bottom of the window opening shall be no more than 36 inches above the floor, and the locks and latches and any window screen or storm window devices that need to be operated to permit exiting shall not be located more than 54 inches above the finished floor.</td>

Exits.  The home is required to have two exterior exit doors, located remotely from each other, as required in MHCSS 3280.105.  This standard requires that a single-section home have the doors no less than 12 feet, center-to-center, from each other, and a multisection home have the doors no less than 20 feet, center-to-center, from each other, when measured in a straight line, regardless of the length of the path of travel between the doors.  One of the required exit doors must be accessible from the doorway of each bedroom and no more than 35 feet away from any bedroom doorway.  An exterior swing door shall have a 28-inch-wide by 74-inch-high clear opening and sliding glass doors shall have a 28-inch-wide by 72-inch-high clear opening.  Each exterior door other than screen/storm doors shall have a key-operated lock that has a passage latch; locks shall not require the use of a key or special tool for operation from the inside of the home.</td>
