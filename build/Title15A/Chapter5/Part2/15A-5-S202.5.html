IFC, Chapter 3, Section 310.8, Hazardous environmental conditions, is deleted and rewritten as follows: "1.  When the fire code official determines that existing or historical hazardous environmental conditions necessitate controlled use of any ignition source, including fireworks, lighters, matches, sky lanterns, and smoking materials, any of the following may occur:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1.  If the existing or historical hazardous environmental conditions exist in a municipality, the legislative body of the municipality may prohibit the ignition or use of an ignition source in:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1.1.  mountainous, brush-covered, forest-covered, or dry grass-covered areas;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1.2.  within 200 feet of waterways, trails, canyons, washes, ravines, or similar areas;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1.3.  the wildland urban interface area, which means the line, area, or zone where structures or other human development meet or intermingle with undeveloped wildland or land being used for an agricultural purpose; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1.4.  a limited area outside the hazardous areas described in this paragraph 1.1 to facilitate a readily identifiable closed area, in accordance with paragraph 2.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2.  If the existing or historical hazardous environmental conditions exist in an unincorporated area, the state forester may prohibit the ignition or use of an ignition source in all or part of the areas described in paragraph 1.1 that are within the unincorporated area, after consulting with the county fire code official who has jurisdiction over that area.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3.  If the existing or historical hazardous environmental conditions exist in a metro township created under <a href="../../Title10/Chapter2A/10-2a-P4.html?v=C10-2a-P4_2015051220150512">Title 10, Chapter 2a, Part 4, Incorporation of Metro Townships and Unincorporated Islands in a County of the First Class on and after May 12, 2015</a>, the metro township legislative body may prohibit the ignition or use of an ignition source in all or part of the areas described in paragraph 1.1 that are within the township.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  If a municipal legislative body, the state forester, or a metro township legislative body closes an area to the discharge of fireworks under paragraph 1, the legislative body or state forester shall:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1.  designate the closed area along readily identifiable features like major roadways, waterways, or geographic features;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2.  ensure that the boundary of the designated closed area is as close as is practical to the defined hazardous area, provided that the closed area may include areas outside of the hazardous area to facilitate a readily identifiable line; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3.  identify the closed area through a written description or map that is readily available to the public.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  A municipal legislative body, the state forester, or a metro township legislative body may close a defined area to the discharge of fireworks due to a historical hazardous environmental condition under paragraph 1 if the legislative body or state forester:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1.  makes a finding that the historical hazardous environmental condition has existed in the defined area before July 1 of at least two of the preceding five years;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2.  produces a map indicating the boundaries, in accordance with paragraph 2, of the defined area described; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3.  before May 1 of each year the defined area is closed, provides the map described in paragraph 3.2 to the county in which the defined area is located.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  A municipal legislative body, the state forester, or a metro township legislative body may not close an area to the discharge of fireworks due to a historical hazardous environmental condition unless the legislative body or state forester provides a map, in accordance with paragraph 3."</td>
