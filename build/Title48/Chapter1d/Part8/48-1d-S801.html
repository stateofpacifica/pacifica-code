The court may assess reasonable attorney's fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith.  The finding may be based on the partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with Subsection <a href="#48-1d-801(7)">(7)</a>.</td>
