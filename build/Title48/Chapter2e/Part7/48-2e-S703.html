On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment.  A charging order constitutes a lien on a judgment debtor's transferable interest and, after the limited partnership has been served with the charging order, requires the limited partnership to pay over to the person to which the charging order was issued any distribution that otherwise would be paid to the judgment debtor.</td>
