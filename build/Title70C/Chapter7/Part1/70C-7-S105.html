<b>70C-7-105.&nbsp;
          </b><b>Extortionate extensions of credit.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is the understanding of the creditor and the debtor at the time an extension of credit is made that delay in making repayment or failure to make repayment could result in the use of violence or other criminal means to cause harm to the person, reputation, or property of any person, the repayment of the extension of credit is unenforceable through any judicial proceedings against the debtor.
