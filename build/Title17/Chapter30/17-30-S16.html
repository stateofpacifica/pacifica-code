          </b><b>Temporary layoffs -- Re-employment register.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When necessary because of lack of funds or work an officer may, with the approval of the commission, be temporarily laid off. Such layoff shall be made according to the lowest rating of the officers of the class of position affected, calculated upon seniority under a method prescribed by the commission. A person serving under temporary or emergency appointment shall be laid off before any merit system officer. A merit system officer who is laid off shall be placed upon a re-employment register to be re-employed in the inverse order in which he is laid off, which register shall take precedence over all eligible registers.
