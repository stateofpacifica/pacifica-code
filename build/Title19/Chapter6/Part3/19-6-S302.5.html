The Legislature finds the language in this part, prior to the passage of this act, did not clearly set forth procedures for identifying responsible parties and allocating among those parties response costs at sites where hazardous substances or materials have been released.  This lack of clarity has interfered with effective allocation of costs of cleanup as required by this part.</td>
