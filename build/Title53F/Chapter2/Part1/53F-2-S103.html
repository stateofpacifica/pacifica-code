It is also the purpose of this chapter to describe the manner in which the state and the school districts shall pay their respective share of the costs of a minimum program.  This chapter also recognizes that each locality should be empowered to provide educational facilities and opportunities beyond the minimum program and accordingly provide a method whereby that latitude of action is permitted and encouraged.</td>
