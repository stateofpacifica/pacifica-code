          </b><b>Loss in student enrollment -- Board action.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid penalizing a school district financially for an excessive loss in student enrollment due to factors beyond its control, the state board may allow a percentage increase in units otherwise allowable during any year when a school district's average daily membership drops more than 4% below the average for the highest two of the preceding three years in the school district.<br>
