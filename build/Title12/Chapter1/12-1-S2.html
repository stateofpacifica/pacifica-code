If a bond becomes forfeited or the sureties for it become liable upon it, any person injured by the acts of forfeiture or by the acts resulting in the sureties' liability, or who by law is entitled to the benefit of the security, may maintain an action on the bond in his own name against the person giving the bond and against the sureties to recover the amount of the bond to which he may be entitled. One recovery does not bar recoveries for other breaches of the bond so long as the sureties are liable in the aggregate only to the extent of the undertaking.</td>
