A manufacturer of a cigarette that the state fire marshal determines cannot be tested in accordance with the test method prescribed in Subsection <a href="#53-7-403(2)(a)">(2)(a)</a> shall propose a test method and performance standard for the cigarette to the state fire marshal.  Upon approval of the proposed test method and a determination by the state fire marshal that the performance standard proposed by the manufacturer is equivalent to the performance standard prescribed in Subsection <a href="#53-7-403(2)(c)">(2)(c)</a>, the manufacturer may employ such test method and performance standard to certify such cigarette pursuant to Section <a href="../../Title53/Chapter7/53-7-S404.html?v=C53-7-S404_1800010118000101">53-7-404</a>.
