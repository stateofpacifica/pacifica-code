Upon taking possession of the institution, the commissioner may do all things necessary to preserve its assets and business, and shall rehabilitate, reorganize, or liquidate the affairs of the institution in a manner he determines to be in the best interests of the institution's depositors and creditors.  Any such determination by the commissioner may not be overruled by a reviewing court unless it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, fraudulent, or contrary to law.  In the event of a liquidation, he shall collect all debts due and claims belonging to it, and may compromise all bad or doubtful debts.  He may sell, upon terms he may determine, any or all of the property of the institution for cash or other consideration.  The commissioner shall give such notice as the court may direct to the institution of the time and place of hearing upon an application to the court for approval of the sale.  The commissioner shall execute and deliver to the purchaser of any property of the institution sold by him those deeds or instruments necessary to evidence the passing of title.</td>

With approval of the court and upon terms and with priority determined by the court, the commissioner may borrow money and issue evidence of indebtedness.  To secure repayment of the indebtedness, he may mortgage, pledge, transfer in trust, or hypothecate any or all of the property of the institution superior to any charge on the property for expenses of the proceeding as provided in Section <a href="../../Title7/Chapter2/7-2-S14.html?v=C7-2-S14_1800010118000101">7-2-14</a>.  These loans may be obtained for the purpose of facilitating liquidation, protecting or preserving the assets in the charge of the commissioner, expediting the making of distributions to depositors and other claimants, aiding in the reopening or reorganization of the institution or its merger or consolidation with another institution, or the sale of all of its assets.  Neither the commissioner nor any special deputy or other person lawfully in charge of the affairs of the institution is under any personal obligation to repay those loans.  The commissioner may take any action necessary or proper to consummate the loan and to provide for its repayment and to give bond when required for the faithful performance of all undertakings in connection with it.  The commissioner or special deputy shall make application to the court for approval of any loan proposed under this section.  Notice of hearing upon the application shall be given as the court directs.  At the hearing upon the application any stockholder or shareholder of the institution or any depositor or other creditor of the institution may appear and be heard on the application.  Prior to the obtaining of a court order, the commissioner or special deputy in charge of the affairs of the institution may make application or negotiate for the loan or loans subject to the obtaining of the court order.</td>

All new deposit instruments issued by the acquiring depository institution may, in accordance with the terms of the plan of reorganization or liquidation, be subject to different amounts, terms, and interest rates than the original deposit instruments of the institution in the possession of the commissioner.  All deposit instruments issued by the acquiring institution shall be considered new deposit obligations of the acquiring institution.  The original deposit instruments issued by the institution in the possession of the commissioner are not liabilities of the acquiring institution, unless assumed by the acquiring institution.  Unpaid claims of depositors against the institution in the possession of the commissioner continue, and may be provided for in the plan of reorganization or liquidation.</td>

The commissioner, after taking possession of any institution or other person subject to the jurisdiction of the department, may terminate any executory contract, including standby letters of credit, unexpired leases and unexpired employment contracts, to which the institution or other person is a party.  If the termination of an executory contract or unexpired lease constitutes a breach of the contract or lease, the date of the breach is the date on which the commissioner took possession of the institution.  Claims for damages for breach of an executory contract shall be filed within 30 days of receipt of notice of the termination, and if allowed, shall be paid in the same manner as all other allowable claims of the same priority out of the assets of the institution available to pay claims.</td>
