The actions of the commissioner are subject to review of the court.  The court has jurisdiction to hear all objections to the actions of the commissioner and may rule upon all motions and actions coming before it.  Standing to seek review of any action of the commissioner or any receiver or liquidator appointed by him is limited to persons whose rights, claims, or interests in the institution would be adversely affected by the action.</td>

The authority of the commissioner under this chapter is of an administrative and not judicial receivership.  The court may not overrule a determination or decision of the commissioner if it is not arbitrary, capricious, fraudulent, or contrary to law.  If the court overrules an action of the commissioner, the matter shall be remanded to the commissioner for a new determination by him, and the new determination shall be subject to court review.</td>
