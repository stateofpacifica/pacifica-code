A change in control of a licensee shall require prior notice to the commissioner.  In the case of a publicly traded corporation, notification shall be made in writing within 15 days of a change or acquisition of control of a licensee.  Upon notification, the commissioner may require information considered necessary to determine whether an application for a license is required.  The commissioner may waive the filing of an application if, in the commissioner's discretion, the change in control does not pose a risk to the interests of the public.</td>
