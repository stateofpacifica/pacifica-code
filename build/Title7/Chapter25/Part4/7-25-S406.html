The commissioner may enter into consent orders at any time with any person to resolve any matter arising under this chapter.  A consent order must be signed by the person to whom it is issued or a duly authorized representative, and must indicate agreement to the terms contained in the consent order.  A consent order need not constitute an admission by any person that any provision of this chapter, or any rule or order made or issued under this chapter, has been violated, nor need it constitute a finding by the commissioner that the person has violated any provision of this chapter or any rule or order made or issued under this chapter.</td>
