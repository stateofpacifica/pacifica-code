If the instrument creating an agency or fiduciary account contains provisions authorizing the trust company, its officers, or its directors to exercise their discretion in the matter of investments, money held in the trust account under that instrument may be invested only in those classes of securities which are approved by the directors of the trust company or a committee of directors appointed for that purpose.  If a trust company acts in any agency or fiduciary capacity under appointment by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall make and account for the investments according to <a href="../../Title75/75.html?v=C75_1800010118000101">Title 75, Utah Uniform Probate Code</a>, unless the underlying instrument provides otherwise.</td>

Money received or held as agent or fiduciary by any trust company which is also a depository institution, whether for investment or distribution, may be deposited in the commercial department or savings department of that trust company to the credit of its trust department.  Whenever the money so deposited in a fiduciary or managing agency account exceed the amount of federal deposit insurance applicable to that account, the trust company shall deliver to the trust department or put under its control collateral security as outlined in Regulation 9.10 of the Comptroller of the Currency.  However, if the instrument creating such a fiduciary or managing agency account expressly provides that money may be deposited to the commercial or savings department of the trust company, then the money may be so deposited without setting aside collateral securities as required under this section and the deposits in the event of insolvency of any such trust company shall be treated as other general deposits are treated.  A trust company that deposits trust funds in its commercial or savings department shall be liable for interest on the deposits only at the rates, if any, paid by the trust company on deposits of like kind not made to the credit of its trust department.</td>
