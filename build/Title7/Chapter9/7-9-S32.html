The money in a joint account may be paid to or on the receipt or withdrawal order of any one of the joint owners during their lifetimes or to or on receipt of withdrawal order of any one of the survivors of them after the death of any one or more of them upon presentation of the pass or account book or other evidence of ownership as required by the bylaws of the credit union.  The opening of the account in such form shall, in the absence of fraud, undue influence, or legal proof of other intent, be conclusive evidence in any action or proceedings concerning said account of the intention of the parties to the account to vest title to such account and the additions thereto in such survivor and survivors.</td>

Payment of all or part of the money in a joint account as provided in Subsections <a href="#7-9-32(2)">(2)</a> and <a href="#7-9-32(3)">(3)</a> shall discharge the credit union from liability with respect to the money paid prior to receipt by the credit union of a written notice from any one of the joint owners directing the credit union not to permit withdrawals in accordance with the terms of the account or the instructions.  After receipt of such notice a credit union may refuse, without incurring liability, to honor any receipt or withdrawal on the account pending determination of the rights of the parties.  No credit union paying any survivor shall be liable for any estate, inheritance, or succession taxes.</td>

Any credit union may issue share or deposit accounts in the name of one or more persons with the provision that upon the death of the owner or owners thereof the proceeds shall be the property of the person or persons designated by the owner or owners and shown by the records of such credit union, but such proceeds shall be subject to the debts of the decedent and the payment of Utah inheritance tax, if any.  However, upon the receipt of acquittance of the person so designated or six months having elapsed from the date of death and no claim on the account having been made for taxes, the credit union may make payment to the persons designated by the deceased owner or owners and having done so is discharged from further obligation and relieved from all further liability for payment made under this subsection.</td>
