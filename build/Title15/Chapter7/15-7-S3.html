The Code provides that interest with respect to certain obligations may not be exempt from federal income taxation unless they are in registered form. It is therefore a matter of state concern that public entities be authorized to provide for the issuance of obligations in registered form. It is a purpose of this act to empower all public entities to establish and maintain a system which permits obligations to be issued in registered form within the meaning of the applicable Code provisions.</td>

It is further a purpose of this act to empower the establishment and maintenance of differing systems of registration of obligations, including system incidents, so as to accommodate the differing impacts upon issuers and varieties of obligations. It is further a purpose of this act to authorize systems that will facilitate the prompt and accurate transfer of registered public obligations and developing practices with regard to the registration and transfer of registered public obligations.</td>
