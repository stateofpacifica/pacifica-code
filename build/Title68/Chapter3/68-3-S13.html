<b>68-3-13.&nbsp;
          </b><b>Printing boldface in numbered bills -- Purpose -- Effect -- Power of Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel to change.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short summary of each section, part, chapter, or title, called boldface, may be printed in numbered bills introduced in the Legislature.  This boldface is not law; it is intended only to highlight the content of each section, part, chapter, or title for legislators.  Inaccurate boldface is not a basis for invalidating legislation.  The Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel is authorized in Section <a href="../../Title36/Chapter12/36-12-S12.html?v=C36-12-S12_1800010118000101">36-12-12</a> to change the boldface in the enrolling process so that it more accurately reflects the substance of each section, part, chapter, or title.
