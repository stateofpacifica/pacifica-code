          </b><b>Payments made to fiduciaries.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who in good faith pays or transfers to a fiduciary any money or other property which the fiduciary as such is authorized to receive is not responsible for the proper application thereof by the fiduciary; and no right or title acquired from the fiduciary in consideration of such payment or transfer is invalid in consequence of a misapplication by the fiduciary.
