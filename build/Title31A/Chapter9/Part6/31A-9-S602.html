A fraternal may create, maintain, and operate social, intellectual, educational, charitable, benevolent, moral, fraternal, patriotic, or religious institutions for the benefit of its members or their families or dependents or for children insured by the fraternal. For that purpose, it may own, hold, or lease real or personal property within or outside of this state. All that property is reported in the annual statement or an appendix to it, but the property is given only a nominal value in the statement. No profit may be made on those institutions, but the income and expenditures are reported separately in, or as an appendix to, the annual statement. Any of these institutions may be separately incorporated under <a href="../../Title16/Chapter10A/16-10a.html?v=C16-10a_1800010118000101">Title 16, Chapter 10a, Utah Revised Business Corporation Act</a>, and ownership of its stock shall be reported at a nominal value.</td>
