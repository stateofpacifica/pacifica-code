Every person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of any equity security of a domestic stock insurance corporation, or who is a director or officer of a domestic stock corporation, shall file with the commissioner within 10 days after he becomes a beneficial owner, director, or officer, and within 10 days after the close of any following calendar month in which there has been a change in his ownership or office, a statement in a form prescribed by the commissioner, of his office and of all the equity securities of the company which he beneficially owns, and of all the changes in either.  The commissioner may accept a copy of a similar statement filed with another regulatory authority in satisfaction of this subsection's requirement.</td>

To prevent the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by a beneficial owner, director, or officer because of his relationship to the corporation, any profit realized by him from the purchase and sale or sale and purchase of any equity security of the corporation within any period of less than six months, unless the security was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, is recoverable by the corporation.  This recovery may be made in spite of any intention by the beneficial owner, director, or officer in entering into the transaction to hold the security purchased or not to repurchase the security sold for a period exceeding six months.  A suit to recover the profit may be instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction by the corporation.  If the corporation fails to bring suit within 60 days after request by the owner of a security of the corporation or if the corporation fails to prosecute it diligently, the owner of any security of the corporation may bring suit or prosecute the action in the name and on behalf of the corporation.  This suit may not be brought more than two years after the date the profit was realized.  This subsection does not apply to any transaction where the beneficial owner was not a beneficial owner both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved, nor does it apply to any transaction which the commissioner, by rule, exempts as not within the purpose of this subsection.</td>
