It may not knowingly solicit in those states in any manner.  Advertisements through printed media, radio, or television do not violate this subsection if they originate outside the state where there is no authority to do business, are not specifically directed to citizens of that state, and have a majority of their audience in states in which the insurer does have a certificate of authority.</td>
