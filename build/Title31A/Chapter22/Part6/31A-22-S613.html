Any policy which contains a provision establishing, as an age limit or otherwise, a date after which the coverage provided by the policy is not effective, and if that date falls within a period for which a premium is accepted by the insurer or if the insurer accepts a premium after that date, the coverage provided by the policy continues in force, subject to any right of cancellation, until the end of the period for which the premium was accepted.

If an insured is otherwise eligible for maternity benefits, a policy may not contain language which requires  an insured to obtain any additional preauthorization or preapproval for customary and reasonable maternity care expenses or for the delivery of the child after an initial preauthorization or preapproval has been obtained from the insurer for prenatal care.  A requirement for notice of admission for delivery is not a requirement for preauthorization or preapproval, however, the maternity benefit may not be denied or diminished for failure to provide admission notice.  The policy may not require the provision of admission notice by only the insured patient.</td>
