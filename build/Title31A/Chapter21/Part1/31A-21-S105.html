The policyholder, his assignee, the loss payee or mortgagee or lienholder under property insurance, and any person whose life or health is insured under a policy may request, in writing, from the company a copy of the application, if he did not receive the policy or a copy of it, or if the policy has been reinstated or renewed without the attachment of a copy of the original application.  If the insurer does not deliver or mail a copy as requested within 30 days after receipt of the request by the insurer or its agent, or in the case of a group policy certificate holder, does not inform that person within the same period how he may inspect the policy or a copy of it and application or enrollment card or a copy of it during normal business hours at a place reasonably convenient to the certificate holder, nothing in the application or enrollment card affects the insurer's obligations under the policy to the person making the request.  Each person whose life or health is insured under a group policy has the same right to request a copy of any document under Subsection <a href="#31A-21-105(1)(b)">(1)(b)</a>.</td>

If after issuance of a policy the insurer acquires knowledge of sufficient facts to constitute a general defense to all claims under the policy, the defense is only available if the insurer notifies the insured within 60 days after acquiring the knowledge of its intention to defend against a claim if one should arise, or within 120 days if the insurer considers it necessary to secure additional medical information and is actively seeking the information at the end of the 60 days. The insurer and insured may mutually agree to a policy rider in order to continue the policy in force with exceptions or modifications.  For purposes of this Subsection <a href="#31A-21-105(5)">(5)</a>, an insurer has acquired knowledge only if the information alleged to give rise to the knowledge was disclosed to the insurer or its agent in connection with communications or investigations associated with the insurance policy under which the subject claim arises.</td>
