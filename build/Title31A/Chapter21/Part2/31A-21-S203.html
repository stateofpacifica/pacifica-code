Any rule creating an authorized clause may prescribe that to be treated as an authorized clause there shall be verbatim or substantial adherence to prescribed language, that certain standards or criteria shall be met, or that certain drafting principles shall be followed.  The rules may also permit liberalization of prescribed language.  A rule may prescribe verbatim adherence only after the commissioner has made a finding that substantial adherence to the prescribed language is not sufficient and that liberalization of prescribed language will frustrate the purposes of the prescription.  If an insurer uses authorized clauses as part of filed forms, the commissioner may only disapprove those clauses under Section <a href="../../Title31A/Chapter21/31A-21-S201.html?v=C31A-21-S201_1800010118000101">31A-21-201</a> upon a finding that improper combination of clauses makes them violate the criteria of Section <a href="../../Title31A/Chapter21/31A-21-S201.html?v=C31A-21-S201_1800010118000101">31A-21-201</a>.</td>
