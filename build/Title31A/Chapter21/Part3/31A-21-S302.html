No person may knowingly collect any excessive amount as a premium or any amount for insurance which is not in the course of processing.  Any amount unknowingly collected shall be returned immediately on learning of the mistake.  Prepayment of premiums pursuant to the policy is not an excessive collection.  Insurance is in the course of processing if an application has been made for it which is being considered by the insurer, even though it has not yet been accepted or rejected.</td>
