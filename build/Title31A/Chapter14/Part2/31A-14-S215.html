The insurer shall attach to the notice a statement of the condition of the insurer, giving the facts showing the necessity for the assessment.  Unless the commissioner orders otherwise under a <a href="../../Title31A/Chapter27/31A-27-P5.html?v=C31A-27-P5_1800010118000101">Chapter 27, Part 5, Administrative Actions</a>, proceeding, a foreign mutual insurer authorized in this state may not make or increase any assessment because of its inability to collect assessments from its members in other states.
