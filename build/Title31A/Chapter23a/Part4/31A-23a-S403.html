An accident and health insurance, life insurance, or annuity product that is subject to the rule may not be sold to a person for whom the product has been determined as inherently unsuitable unless that person purchasing the product signs a receipt acknowledging having received a statement that expresses that the product has been determined by the commissioner to be inherently unsuitable for persons of certain ages or in certain conditions of health.</td>

Unless the insurer or its appointed licensee establishes that its sale of coverage is inconsistent with the rule made under Subsection <a href="#31A-23a-403(1)">(1)</a> is due to excusable neglect, the purchaser may treat the sale as voidable, if acted upon by the insured within a two-year period from the date of sale.</td>
