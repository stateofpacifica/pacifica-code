The present value of future income derived from securities is determined by rule adopted by the commissioner.  A parent insurer may attribute value to a security of its subsidiary only if the parent insurer is being paid dividends or interest on the security, and only if the parent insurer can reasonably anticipate that dividends or interest will continue to be paid on the security.</td>
