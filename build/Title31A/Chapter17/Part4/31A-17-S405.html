A fraternal may be organized for the transaction of business on a plan set forth in the contract which provides for sufficient contributions by each member each year to pay the member's share of the actual death claims of the year, through advance payments graded according to a mortality table approved by the commissioner, without any reserve, or with a reserve which may accumulate from overpayments of individual members.  If this type of reserve does accumulate, each member shall be informed each year of the member's credit and of the cost of the member's insurance.</td>
