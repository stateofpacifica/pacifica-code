          </b><b>Bonds or notes -- Issuance -- Purposes -- Payment -- Maturity of bond anticipation notes.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An agency may, from time to time, issue its negotiable bonds or notes for the purpose of financing residential rehabilitation as authorized by this act and for the purpose of funding or refunding these bonds or notes in the same manner as it may issue other bonds or notes as provided in <a href="../../Title17C/Chapter1/17C-1-P5.html?v=C17C-1-P5_1800010118000101">Title 17C, Chapter 1, Part 5, Agency Bonds</a>.  Every issue of its bonds shall be a special obligation of the agency payable from all or any part of the revenues specified in the act or funds legally received by the agency.  In anticipation of the sale of the bonds, the agency may issue negotiable bond anticipation notes in accordance with Section <a href="../../Title11/Chapter14/11-14-S311.html?v=C11-14-S311_1800010118000101">11-14-311</a>, and may renew such notes from time to time.  Bond anticipation notes may be paid from the proceeds of sale of the bonds of the agency in anticipation of which they were issued.  Bond anticipation notes and agreements relating thereto and the resolution or resolutions authorizing the notes and agreements may obtain any provisions, conditions, or limitations which a bond, agreement relating thereto, or bond resolution of the agency may contain except that any note or renewal thereof shall mature at a time not later than five years from the date of the issuance of the original note.
