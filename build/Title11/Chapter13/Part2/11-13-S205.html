It is declared that the policy of the state is to assure the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens, that adequate sewage and wastewater treatment plants and facilities are essential to the well-being of the citizens of the state and that the acquisition of adequate sewage and wastewater treatment plants and facilities on a regional basis in accordance with federal law and state and federal water quality standards and effluent standards in order to provide services to public agencies is a matter of statewide concern and is in the public interest.  It is found and declared that there is a statewide need to provide for regional sewage and wastewater treatment plants and facilities, and as a matter of express legislative determination it is declared that the compelling need of the state for construction of regional sewage and wastewater treatment plants and facilities requires the creation of entities under the Interlocal Cooperation Act to own, construct, operate, and finance sewage and wastewater treatment plants and facilities; and it is the purpose of this law to provide for the accomplishment thereof in the manner provided in this section.</td>
