It is found and declared that investors in economic development or new venture investment funds require for the overall security of their investments reasonable diversification of investment portfolios and that, in the course of this diversification, investments are often syndicated or jointly made among several financial institutions or funds.  It is expressly found and declared that an economic development or new venture investment fund shall from time to time for its optimal profitability and efficiency (which are important for the security and profit of bond purchasers providing funds therefor) cooperate with others who may be located outside of Utah or the county or municipality where the fund is headquartered in the making of investments and that the fund shall be free in the interests of reciprocal relationships with other financial institutions and diversification of risks to invest from time to time in enterprises that are located outside of Utah or the counties or municipalities.  It is specifically found that such activity by a locally managed fund, funded in whole or in part with the proceeds of bonds sold under this chapter, is within the public purposes of the state and any county or municipality offering the bonds, provided that the fund locates within Utah or the county or municipality its headquarters where its actual investment decisions and management functions occur and limits the aggregate amount of its investments in companies located outside of Utah to an amount that in the aggregate does not exceed the aggregate amount of investments made by institutions and funds located outside of Utah in Utah companies, that the locally managed fund has sponsored or in which it has invested and that it has brought to the attention of investors outside of Utah.</td>
