Refunding bonds shall have all the qualities of negotiable paper, shall be incontestable in the hands of bona fide purchasers or holders for value, and are not invalid for any irregularity or defect in the proceedings for their issuance and sale.  This chapter is intended to afford an alternative method for the issuance of refunding bonds by public bodies and may not be construed to deprive any public body of the right to issue bonds for refunding purposes under authority of any other statute, but this chapter, nevertheless, shall constitute full authority for the issue and sale of refunding bonds by public bodies.  Section <a href="../../Title11/Chapter1/11-1-S1.html?v=C11-1-S1_1800010118000101">11-1-1</a>, however, is not applicable to refunding bonds.</td>

Any public body subject to any budget law shall in its annual budget make proper provision for the payment of principal and interest currently falling due on refunding bonds, but no provision need be made in the budget prior to the issuance of the refunding bonds for their issuance or for the expenditure of the proceeds from them.</td>
