If the use of a facsimile signature is authorized by the body empowered by law to authorize the issuance of the bonds or other obligations of any agency, instrumentality, or institution of this state or of any municipal corporation, political subdivision, improvement district, taxing district, or other governmental entity within the state, whether or not issued under this chapter, any officer so authorized may execute, authenticate, certify, or endorse, or cause to be executed, authenticated, certified, or endorsed the bond or other obligation, or any certificate required to be executed on the back thereof, with a facsimile signature in lieu of his manual signature if at least one signature required or permitted to be placed on the face thereof shall be manually subscribed.  Upon compliance with this chapter by the authorized officer, his facsimile signature has the same legal effect as his manual signature.  When any seal is required in the execution, authentication, certification, or endorsement of the bond or other obligation, or any certificate required to be executed on the back thereof, the authorized officer may cause the seal to be printed, engraved, lithographed, stamped, or otherwise placed in facsimile thereon.  The facsimile seal has the same legal effect as the impression of the seal.</td>
