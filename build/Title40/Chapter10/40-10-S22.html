Whenever, on the basis of any information available, including receipt of information from any person, the division has reason to believe that any person is in violation of any requirement of this chapter or any permit condition required by this chapter, the division shall immediately order inspection of the surface coal mining operation at which the alleged violation is occurring, unless the information available to the division is a result of a previous inspection of the surface coal mining operation.  When the inspection results from information provided to the division by any person, the division shall notify that person when the inspection is proposed to be carried out, and that person shall be allowed to accompany the inspector during the inspection.</td>

When, on the basis of any inspection, the division determines that any condition or practices exist, or that any permittee is in violation of any requirement of this chapter or any permit condition required by this chapter, which condition, practice, or violation also creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, or is causing, or can reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the division shall immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or the portion thereof relevant to the condition, practice, or violation.  The cessation order shall remain in effect until the division determines that the condition, practice, or violation has been abated, or until modified, vacated, or terminated by the division pursuant to Subsection <a href="#40-10-22(1)(e)">(1)(e)</a>.  Where the division finds that the ordered cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, or any portion of same, will not completely abate the imminent danger to health or safety of the public or the significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the division shall, in addition to the cessation order, impose affirmative obligations on the operator requiring him to take whatever steps the division deems necessary to abate the imminent danger or the significant environmental harm.</td>

If upon expiration of the period of time as originally fixed or subsequently extended, for good cause shown, and upon the written finding of the division, the division finds that the violation has not been abated, it shall immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or the portion of same relevant to the violation.

If a hearing is requested, the board shall give notice in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure of the board.
