          </b><b>Restrictions of production not authorized.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This act shall never be construed to require, permit or authorize the board or any court to make, enter or enforce any order, rule, regulation, or judgment requiring restriction of production of any pool or of any well (except a well drilled in violation of Section <a href="../../Title40/Chapter6/40-6-S6.html?v=C40-6-S6_2015051220150512">40-6-6</a> hereof) to an amount less than the well or pool can produce unless such restriction is necessary to prevent waste and protect correlative rights, or the operation of a well without sufficient oil or gas production to cover current operating costs and provide a reasonable return, without regard to original drilling costs.
