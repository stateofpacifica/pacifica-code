A powerholder's compliance with formal requirements of appointment imposed by the donor is sufficient only if the powerholder substantially complies with the conditions, requirements, and formalities set forth in the power of appointment, including complying with all the requirements for making specific reference to the power, that the power shall be exercised in a specific document such as a will, or that the document exercising the power shall be witnessed or notarized. If the donor limited the powerholder's exercise to a validly executed will, substantial compliance may not include the exercise of the power by a trust or another document not meeting the requirements of a properly executed will.</td>
