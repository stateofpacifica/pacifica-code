          </b><b>Informal probate -- Duty of registrar -- Effect of informal probate.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will, the registrar, upon making the findings required by Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S303.html?v=C75-3-S303_1800010118000101">75-3-303</a> shall issue a written statement of informal probate if at least 10 days have elapsed since the date of the notice required by Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S306.html?v=C75-3-S306_1800010118000101">75-3-306</a>, or if at least 120 hours have elapsed since the decedent's death and all persons entitled to notice under Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S306.html?v=C75-3-S306_1800010118000101">75-3-306</a> have waived such notice in writing. Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding. No defect in the application or procedure relating thereto which leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void.
