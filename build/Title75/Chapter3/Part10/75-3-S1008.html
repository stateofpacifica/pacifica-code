<b>75-3-1008.&nbsp;
          </b><b>Subsequent administration.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the personal representative discharged or after one year after a closing statement has been filed, the court upon petition of any interested person and upon notice as it directs may appoint the same or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently-discovered estate. If a new appointment is made, unless the court orders otherwise, the provisions of this code apply as appropriate; but no claim previously barred may be asserted in the subsequent administration.
