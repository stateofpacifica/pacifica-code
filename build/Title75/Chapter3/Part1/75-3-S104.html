After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by this <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3.html?v=C75-3_1800010118000101">Chapter 3, Probate of Wills and Administration</a>. After distribution a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S1004.html?v=C75-3-S1004_1800010118000101">75-3-1004</a> or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S1005.html?v=C75-3-S1005_1800010118000101">75-3-1005</a>.
