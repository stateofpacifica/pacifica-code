A personal representative and an attorney are entitled to reasonable compensation for their services.  If a petition is filed which either directly or indirectly seeks approval of the personal representative's compensation or the attorney's compensation and if no objection is filed by an interested person to the compensation requested, reasonable compensation shall be the compensation sought in the petition. When an interested person objects to the personal representative's compensation, the court shall determine reasonable compensation for the personal representative based on the quality, quantity, and value of the services rendered to the estate and the circumstances under which those services were rendered, including the practice for other fiduciaries who are in similar circumstances to the personal representative in question. When an interested person objects to the attorney's compensation, the court shall determine reasonable compensation for the attorney.</td>
