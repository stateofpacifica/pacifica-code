<b>75-3-802.&nbsp;
          </b><b>Statutes of limitations.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless an estate is insolvent the personal representative, with the consent of all successors whose interests would be affected, may waive any defense of limitations available to the estate. If the defense is not waived, no claim which was barred by any statute of limitations at the time of the decedent's death shall be allowed or paid. The running of any statute of limitations measured from some other event than death and advertisement for claims against a decedent is suspended during the three months following the decedent's death but resumes thereafter as to claims not barred pursuant to the sections which follow. For purposes of any statute of limitations, the proper presentation of a claim under Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S804.html?v=C75-3-S804_1800010118000101">75-3-804</a> is equivalent to commencement of a proceeding on the claim.
