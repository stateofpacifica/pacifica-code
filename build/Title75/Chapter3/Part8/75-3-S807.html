Upon the expiration of the earliest of the time limitations provided in Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S803.html?v=C75-3-S803_1800010118000101">75-3-803</a> for the presentation of claims, the personal representative shall proceed to pay the claims allowed against the estate in the order of priority prescribed, after making provision for homestead, family, and support allowances, for claims already presented which have not yet been allowed or whose allowance has been appealed, and for unbarred claims which may yet be presented, including costs and expenses of administration.  By petition to the court in a proceeding for the purpose, or by appropriate motion if the administration is supervised, a claimant whose claim has been allowed but not paid as provided in this section may secure an order directing the personal representative to pay the claim to the extent that funds of the estate are available for the payment.</td>
