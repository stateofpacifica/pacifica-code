As to claims presented in the manner described in Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S804.html?v=C75-3-S804_1800010118000101">75-3-804</a> and within the time limit prescribed in Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter3/75-3-S803.html?v=C75-3-S803_1800010118000101">75-3-803</a>, the personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been allowed or disallowed.  If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the personal representative changes the decision concerning the claim, the personal representative shall notify the claimant.  The personal representative may not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to commence a proceeding on the claim has expired and the claim has been barred.  If the notice of disallowance warns the claimant of the impending bar, a claim which is disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative is barred so far as not allowed, unless the claimant seeks a court ordered allowance by filing a petition for allowance in the court or by commencing a proceeding against the personal representative not later than 60 days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance.  If the personal representative fails to mail notice to a claimant of action on the claim within 60 days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired, this failure has the effect of a notice of allowance.</td>
