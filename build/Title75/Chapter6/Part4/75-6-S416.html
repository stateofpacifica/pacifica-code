What does the Transfer on Death (TOD) deed do?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. When you die, this deed transfers the described property, subject to any liens or mortgages (or other encumbrances) on the property at your death. Probate is not required. The TOD deed has no effect until you die. You can revoke it at any time. You are also free to transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime. If you do not own any interest in the property when you die, this deed will have no effect.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. How do I make a TOD deed?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Complete this form. Have it acknowledged before a notary public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments. Record the form in each county where any part of the property is located. The form has no effect unless it is acknowledged and recorded before your death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. Is the "legal description" of the property necessary?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Yes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. How do I find the "legal description" of the property?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. This information may be on the deed you received when you became an owner of the property. This information may also be available in the office of the county recorder for the county where the property is located. If you are not absolutely sure, consult a lawyer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Yes. If you have not yet recorded the deed and want to change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the deed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. How do I "record" the TOD deed?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office of the county recorder of the county where the property is located. Follow the instructions given by the county recorder to make the form part of the official property records. If the property is in more than one county, you should record the deed in each county.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Yes. The TOD deed is revocable. No one, including the beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. There are three ways to revoke a recorded TOD deed: (1) Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and record it in each county where the property is located. (2) Complete and acknowledge a new TOD deed that disposes of the same property, and record it in each county where the property is located. (3) Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime by a recorded deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You may not revoke the TOD deed by will.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I do?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Do not complete this form under pressure. Seek help from a trusted family member, a friend, or a lawyer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. No, but it is recommended. Secrecy can cause later complications and might make it easier for others to commit fraud.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. If I sign a TOD deed and designate my two children as beneficiaries, and one of them dies before me, does the interest of my child that dies before me pass to his or her children?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. No. Everything will go to your surviving child unless you record a new transfer on death deed to state otherwise. If you have questions regarding how to word a new transfer on death deed, you are encouraged to consult a lawyer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Q. I have other questions about this form. What should I do?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. This form is designed to fit some but not all situations. If you have other questions, you are encouraged to consult a lawyer.<br>
