          </b><b>Financial institution protection -- Payment on signature of one party.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial institutions may enter into multiple-party accounts to the same extent that they may enter into single-party accounts. Any multiple-party account may be paid, on request, to any one or more of the parties. A financial institution shall not be required to inquire as to the source of funds received for deposit to a multiple-party account, or to inquire as to the proposed application of any sum withdrawn from an account, for purposes of establishing net contributions.
