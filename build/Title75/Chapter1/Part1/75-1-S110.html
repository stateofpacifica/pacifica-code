The amount of any increase or decrease is computed by multiplying each dollar amount by the percentage by which the CPI for the calendar year immediately preceding the year of death exceeds or is less than the reference base index.  If any increase or decrease produced by the computation is not a multiple of $100, the increase or decrease is rounded down, if an increase, or up, if a decrease, to the next multiple of $100, but for the purpose of Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter2/75-2-S405.html?v=C75-2-S405_1800010118000101">75-2-405</a>, the periodic installment amount is the lump sum amount divided by 12.  If the CPI for 2009 is changed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the reference base index shall be revised using the rebasing factor reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or other comparable data if a rebasing factor is not reported.</td>
