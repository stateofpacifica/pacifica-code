<b>75-2-710.&nbsp;
          </b><b>Worthier-title doctrine abolished.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine of worthier title is abolished as a rule of law and as a rule of construction.  Language in a governing instrument describing the beneficiaries of a disposition as the transferor's "heirs," "heirs-at-law," "next-of-kin," "distributees," "relatives," or "family," or language of similar import, does not create or presumptively create a reversionary interest in the transferor.
