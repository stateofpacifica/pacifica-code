If the election is exercised on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person, the court shall set aside that portion of the elective-share and supplemental elective-share amounts due from the decedent's probate estate and recipients of the decedent's nonprobate transfers to others under Subsections <a href="../../Title75/Chapter2/75-2-S209.html?v=C75-2-S209_1800010118000101#75-2-209(2)">75-2-209(2)</a> and <a href="../../Title75/Chapter2/75-2-S209.html?v=C75-2-S209_1800010118000101#75-2-209(3)">(3)</a> and shall appoint a trustee to administer that property for the support of the surviving spouse.  For the purposes of this subsection, an election on behalf of a surviving spouse by an agent under a durable power of attorney is presumed to be on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person.  The trustee shall administer the trust in accordance with the following terms and such additional terms as the court determines appropriate:
