A health savings account is established on the first day an individual is covered by a high deductible health plan, as defined in Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The health savings account shall be opened with a trustee or custodian within the time prescribed by law, without extensions, for filing a federal income tax return for that year.  A health savings account is established regardless of a transfer of cash or other property to the account and, unless required by the trustee or custodian, it is not necessary for any party to sign a health savings account trust or custodial agreement regarding the health savings account.</td>
