As to claims presented in the manner described in Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter7/75-7-S510.html?v=C75-7-S510_1800010118000101">75-7-510</a> and within the time limit prescribed in Section <a href="../../Title75/Chapter7/75-7-S509.html?v=C75-7-S509_1800010118000101">75-7-509</a>, the trustee may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been allowed or disallowed.  If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the trustee changes the decision concerning the claim, the trustee shall notify the claimant.  The trustee may not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to commence a proceeding on the claim has expired and the claim has been barred.  If the notice of disallowance warns the claimant of the impending bar, a claim which is disallowed in whole or in part by the trustee is barred so far as not allowed, unless the claimant seeks a court-ordered allowance by filing a petition for allowance in the court or by commencing a proceeding against the trustee not later than 60 days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance.  If the trustee fails to mail notice to a claimant of action on the claim within 60 days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired, this failure has the effect of a notice of allowance.</td>
