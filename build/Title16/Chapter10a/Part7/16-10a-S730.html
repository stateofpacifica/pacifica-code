One or more shareholders may create a voting trust, conferring on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by signing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust, and transferring to the trustee the shares with respect to which the trustee is to act.  When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and promptly cause the corporation to receive copies of the list and agreement.  Thereafter the trustee shall cause the corporation to receive changes to the list promptly as they occur and amendments to the agreement promptly as they are made.</td>
