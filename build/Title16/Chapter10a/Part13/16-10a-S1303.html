A record shareholder may assert dissenters' rights as to fewer than all the shares registered in his name only if the shareholder dissents with respect to all shares beneficially owned by any one person and causes the corporation to receive written notice which states the dissent and the name and address of each person on whose behalf dissenters' rights are being asserted.  The rights of a partial dissenter under this subsection are determined as if the shares as to which the shareholder dissents and the other shares held of record by him were registered in the names of different shareholders.</td>
