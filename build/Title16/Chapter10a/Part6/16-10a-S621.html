The board of directors may authorize the issuance of shares for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services performed, contracts or arrangements for services to be performed, or other securities of the corporation.  The terms and conditions of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to be provided in the future to the corporation, including contracts or arrangements for services to be performed, shall be set forth in writing.  However, the failure to set forth the terms and conditions in writing does not affect the validity of the issuance of any shares issued for any consideration, or their status as fully paid and nonassessable shares.</td>
