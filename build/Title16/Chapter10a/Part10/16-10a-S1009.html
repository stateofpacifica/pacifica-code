          </b><b>Effect of amendment.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amendment to articles of incorporation does not affect a cause of action existing against or in favor of the corporation, a proceeding to which the corporation is a party, or the existing rights of persons other than shareholders of the corporation.  An amendment changing a corporation's name does not abate a proceeding brought by or against the corporation in its former name.
