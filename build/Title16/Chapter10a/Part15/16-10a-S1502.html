A foreign corporation that transacts business in this state without authority is subject to a civil penalty, payable to this state, of $100 for each day in which it transacts business in this state without authority. However, the penalty may not exceed a total of $5,000 for each year. Each officer of a foreign corporation who authorizes, directs, or participates in the transaction of business in this state without authority and each agent of a foreign corporation who transacts business in this state on behalf of a foreign corporation that is not authorized is subject to a civil penalty, payable to this state, not exceeding $1,000.</td>

The civil penalties set forth in Subsection <a href="#16-10a-1502(4)">(4)</a> may be recovered in an action brought in an appropriate court in Salt Lake County or in any other county in this state in which the corporation has a registered, principal, or business office or in which it has transacted business. Upon a finding by the court that a foreign corporation or any of its officers or agents have transacted business in this state in violation of this part, the court shall issue, in addition to or instead of a civil penalty, an injunction restraining the further transaction of the business of the foreign corporation and the further exercise of any corporate rights and privileges in this state. Upon issuance of the injunction, the foreign corporation shall be enjoined from transacting business in this state until all civil penalties have been paid, plus any interest and court costs assessed by the court, and until the foreign corporation has otherwise complied with the provisions of this part.</td>
