On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the financial rights of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment.  A charging order issued under this Subsection <a href="#16-16-605(1)">(1)</a> constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's financial rights and requires the limited cooperative association to pay over to the creditor or receiver, to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment, any distribution that would otherwise be paid to the judgment debtor.</td>

Upon a showing that distributions under a charging order will not pay the judgment debt within a reasonable time, the court may foreclose the lien and order the sale of the financial rights.  The purchaser at the foreclosure sale obtains only the financial rights that are subject to the charging order, does not thereby become a member, and is subject to Section <a href="../../Title16/Chapter16/16-16-S603.html?v=C16-16-S603_1800010118000101">16-16-603</a>.</td>

At any time before a sale pursuant to a foreclosure, a member or transferee whose financial rights are subject to a charging order under Subsection <a href="#16-16-605(1)">(1)</a> may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order.</td>
