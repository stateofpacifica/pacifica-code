<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The district courts for the district wherein the dealer resides or wherein the dealership was to be established shall have jurisdiction over any action involving a violation of this act.  In addition to such relief as may be available at common law, the courts may grant such equitable relief, both interim and final, as may be necessary to remedy those violations including declaratory judgments, injunctive relief, and punitive damages as well as actual damages.  The prevailing party may, in the court's sole discretion, be awarded attorney's fees and expert witness fees in addition to such other relief as the court may deem equitable.  In any action for failure to renew an agreement, damages shall be limited to actual damages, including the value of the dealer's equity in the dealership, together with reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
