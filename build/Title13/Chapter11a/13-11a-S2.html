It is prima facie evidence that a price is other than a regular price when it was not offered as the nondiscount price of the goods or services for the 15 days immediately preceding an advertisement of the price, and the price change during the 15 day period was not due to price changes inherent in the pricing of seasonal or perishable goods, due to changes in cost of the goods or services to the supplier, or due to pricing changes made to match a competitor's price.</td>
