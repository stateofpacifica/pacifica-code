The authorized person of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any person on furlough. For that purpose no formalities will be required other than establishing the authority of that person and the identity of the furloughee to be retaken. All legal requirements to obtain extradition of fugitives from justice are hereby expressly waived on the part of the states party hereto as to such persons. The decision of the sending state to retake a person on furlough shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state; provided, however, that if at the time when a state seeks to retake a furloughee there should be pending against him within the receiving state any criminal charge or should he be suspected of having committed within that state a criminal offense, he shall not be retaken without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or from imprisonment for the offense.</td>

The receiving state shall, upon a furlough violation of which it has knowledge, promptly notify the sending state.

If the grant of furlough is terminated due to the violation, the right and responsibility to retake the furloughee shall be that of the sending state but nothing contained herein shall prevent the receiving state from assisting the sending state toward retaking and returning the furloughee except in instances where the receiving state shall subject the furloughee to confinement for a crime allegedly committed during the furlough within its boundaries. All costs in connection therewith shall be chargeable to the sending state unless costs arise from an escape from confinement in the receiving state.</td>
