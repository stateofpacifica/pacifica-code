If any prosecutor authorized under Subsection <a href="#77-22b-1(1)(a)">(1)(a)</a> intends to compel a witness to testify or provide evidence or information under a grant of use immunity, the prosecutor shall notify the witness by written notice.

If a witness is granted immunity under Subsection <a href="#77-22b-1(1)">(1)</a> and is later prosecuted for an offense that was part of the transaction or events about which the witness was compelled to testify or produce evidence or information under a grant of immunity, the burden is on the prosecution to show by a preponderance of the evidence that no use or derivative use was made of the compelled testimony, evidence, or information in the subsequent case against the witness, and to show that any proffered evidence was derived from sources totally independent of the compelled testimony, evidence, or information.  The remedy for not establishing that any proffered evidence was derived from sources totally independent of the compelled testimony, evidence, or information is suppression of that evidence only.</td>
