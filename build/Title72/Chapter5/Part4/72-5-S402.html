The Legislature finds and declares that the planning and preservation of transportation corridors is a public purpose, that the acquisition of public rights in private property for possible use as a transportation corridor years in advance is a public purpose, and that acquisition of public rights in private property for possible use as alternative transportation corridors is a public purpose, even if one or more of the transportation corridors is eventually not used for a public purpose, so long as reasonable evidence exists at the time of acquisition that the transportation facility will be developed within the time period established under this part.</td>
