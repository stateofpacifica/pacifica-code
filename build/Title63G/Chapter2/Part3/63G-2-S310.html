The classification of a record is not permanent and a record that was not classified public under this act shall become a public record when the justification for the original or any subsequent restrictive classification no longer exists.  A record shall be presumed to be public 75 years after its creation, except that a record that contains information about an individual 21 years old or younger at the time of the record's creation shall be presumed to be public 100 years after its creation.</td>
