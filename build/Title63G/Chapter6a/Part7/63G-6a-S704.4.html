          </b><b>Limited addenda to requests for proposals.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the deadline for submitting proposals, a procurement unit may, at the discretion of the procurement official, issue a request for proposals addendum that has limited application only to offerors that have submitted proposals, if the addendum does not change the request for proposals in a way that, in the opinion of the procurement official, would likely have affected the number of proposals submitted in response to the request for proposals had the addendum been included in the original request for proposals.<br>
