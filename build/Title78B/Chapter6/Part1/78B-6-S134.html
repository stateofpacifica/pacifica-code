Once a child has been placed with, relinquished to, or ordered into the custody of a child-placing agency for purposes of adoption, the agency shall have custody and control of the child and is responsible for his care, maintenance, and support.  The agency may delegate the responsibility for care, maintenance, and support, including any necessary medical or surgical treatment, to the petitioner once the petitioner has received the child into his home.  However, until the final decree of adoption is entered by the court, the agency has the right to the custody and control of the child.</td>
