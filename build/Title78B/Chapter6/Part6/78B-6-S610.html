<b>78B-6-610.&nbsp;
          </b><b>Disobedience of writ -- Punishment.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a peremptory writ of mandate or writ of prohibition has been issued and directed to an inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, and the court determines that any member of the tribunal, corporation, board, or person upon whom the writ was personally served has, without just excuse, refused or neglected to obey the writ, the court may, upon motion, impose a fine not exceeding $500. In cases of persistence in a refusal of obedience, the court may order the party to be imprisoned until the writ is obeyed, and may make any orders necessary and proper for enforcement of the writ.
