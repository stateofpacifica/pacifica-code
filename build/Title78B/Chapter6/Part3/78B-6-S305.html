Whenever by the provisions of this chapter an officer is required to keep in custody a person arrested on a warrant of attachment and to bring the person before a court or judge, the inability from illness or otherwise of the person to attend is a sufficient excuse for not bringing the person up; and the officer must not confine a person arrested upon the warrant in a prison or otherwise restrain the person of personal liberty, except so far as may be necessary to secure the person's personal attendance.</td>
