          </b><b>Deficiency judgment -- Execution.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it appears that the proceeds of the sale are insufficient and a balance still remains due, the judgment shall be docketed by the clerk and execution may be issued for the balance as in other cases.  A general execution may not be issued until after the sale of the mortgaged property and the application of the amount realized to the preceding judgment.
