          </b><b>Judgment against sheriff -- When conclusive against sureties on indemnity bond.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an action is brought against a sheriff for an act done by virtue of his office and he gives written notice to the sureties on any bond of indemnity received by him, the judgment recovered is conclusive evidence of his right to recover against such sureties.  The court may, on motion, and upon five days notice, order judgment to be entered against them for the amount recovered, including costs.
