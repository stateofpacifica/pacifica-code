Upon a finding of liability and an awarding of damages by the trier of fact, the court shall receive evidence concerning the total amounts of collateral sources which have been paid to or for the benefit of the plaintiff or are otherwise available to him.  The court shall also take testimony of any amount which has been paid, contributed, or forfeited by, or on behalf of the plaintiff or members of his immediate family to secure his right to any collateral source benefit which he is receiving as a result of his injury, and shall offset any reduction in the award by those amounts.  Evidence may not be received and a reduction may not be made with respect to future collateral source benefits except as specified in Subsection <a href="#78B-3-405(5)">(5)</a>.</td>
