<b>78B-15-507.&nbsp;
          </b><b>Additional genetic testing.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal shall order additional genetic testing upon the request of a party who contests the result of the original testing.  If the previous genetic testing identified a man as the father of the child under Section <a href="../../Title78B/Chapter15/78B-15-S505.html?v=C78B-15-S505_1800010118000101">78B-15-505</a>, the tribunal may not order additional testing unless the party provides advance payment for the testing.  If the tribunal orders a second genetic test in accordance with this section, the additional testing must be completed within 45 days of the tribunal's order or the requesting party's objection to the first test will be automatically denied.  If failure to complete the test occurs because of noncooperation of the mother or unavailability of the child, the time will be tolled.
