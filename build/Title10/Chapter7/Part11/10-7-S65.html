          </b><b>Party plaintiff -- Successive actions permitted.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All actions brought to recover any fine or to enforce any penalty under an ordinance of a city or town shall be brought in the corporate name of the city or town as plaintiff.  No prosecution, recovery, or acquittal for the violation of any such ordinance shall constitute a defense to any other prosecution of the same person for any other violation of any such ordinance although the different causes of action existed at the same time and if united would not have exceeded the jurisdiction of a justice court judge.
