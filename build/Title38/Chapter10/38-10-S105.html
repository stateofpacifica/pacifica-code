Within 30 days after filing the notice of lien, the lien claimant shall deliver or mail a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the owner of the interest liened.  If the owner's current address is not readily available, a copy of the notice may be mailed to the last-known address of the owner, as shown by the records of the county recorder in any county where the land is situated.  Failure to deliver or mail the notice of lien to the owner shall not cause the lien to be void but precludes the lien claimant from an award of costs and attorney fees against the owner in an action to enforce the lien.</td>
