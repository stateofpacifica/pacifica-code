Purposes.  The purposes of this agreement are to:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  Adhere to the principle that each participating jurisdiction should have the freedom to develop vehicle size and weight standards that it determines to be most appropriate to its economy and highway system.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  Establish a system recommending the operation of vehicles traveling between two or more participating jurisdictions at more adequate size and weight standards.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  Promote uniformity among participating jurisdictions in vehicle size and weight standards on the basis of the objectives set forth in this agreement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)  Secure uniformity insofar as possible, of administrative procedures in the enforcement of recommended vehicle size and weight standards.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)  Provide means for the encouragement and utilization of research which will facilitate the achievement of the foregoing purposes, with due regard for the findings set forth in section 1 of this article.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)  Study and recommend appropriate highway user fees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)  Facilitate communication between legislators, state transportation administrators, and commercial industry representatives in addressing the emerging highway transportation issues in participating jurisdictions.<br>
