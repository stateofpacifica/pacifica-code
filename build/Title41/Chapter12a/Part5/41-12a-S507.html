Upon receipt of certification from the official of another state that the operating privilege of a Utah resident has been suspended in the other state for failure to deposit post-accident security for the payment of judgments arising out of a motor vehicle accident, under circumstances which would require the deposit in Utah, the department shall suspend the license of the resident if he was the operator, and all of his registrations if he was the owner of a motor vehicle involved in the accident.  These suspensions continue until the Utah resident furnishes evidence of his compliance with the law of the other state relating to the deposit of post-accident security.</td>
