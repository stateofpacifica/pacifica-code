If a certificate of title has been issued, and the same lienholder as shown by the records of the division only grants additional funds to the same owner as shown by the records of the division, no further recording is required and no subsequent certificate of title need be applied for or issued, if the original certificate or valid duplicate has remained in possession of the lienholder and the lien has not been released and the certificate has not been delivered to the owner.</td>
