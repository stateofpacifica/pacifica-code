          </b><b>Attempted conveyance of more than grantor owns -- Effect.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A conveyance made by an owner of an estate for life or years, purporting to convey a greater estate than he could lawfully transfer, does not work a forfeiture of his estate, but passes to the grantee all the estate which the grantor could lawfully transfer.
