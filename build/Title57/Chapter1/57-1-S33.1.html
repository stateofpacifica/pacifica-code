If a reconveyance is erroneously recorded by a beneficiary, the effect of the reconveyance may be nullified and the trust deed reinstated by the recording of a corrective affidavit executed by the then current beneficiary describing the trust deed and setting forth the fact of the erroneous reconveyance.  Upon the recording of a corrective affidavit or similar instrument, the trust deed has the same priority as it did prior to the erroneous reconveyance.  However, any lien or interest that was recorded or attached to the trust deed property between the time of the recording of the erroneous reconveyance and the recording of the corrective affidavit or similar instrument has priority over the reinstated trust deed, unless the lien or interest was recorded or attached with actual knowledge that the trust deed had been reconveyed erroneously.</td>
