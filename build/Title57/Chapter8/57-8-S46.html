This procedure is governed by Utah Code, Sections <a href="#57-8-46">57-8-46</a> and <a href="../../Title57/Chapter8/57-8-S47.html?v=C57-8-S47_1800010118000101">57-8-47</a>, and is being followed in order to enforce the association's lien against your unit and to collect the amount of an unpaid assessment against your unit, together with any applicable late fees and the costs, including attorney fees, associated with the foreclosure proceeding. This procedure cannot and will not be used to foreclose upon your unit for delinquent fines for a violation of the association of unit owners' governing documents. Alternatively, you have the right to demand that a foreclosure of your property for delinquent assessments be conducted in a lawsuit with the oversight of a judge.  If you make this demand, the association of unit owners may also include a claim for delinquent fines for a violation of the association of unit owners' governing documents. Additionally, if you make this demand and the association prevails in the lawsuit, the costs and attorney fees associated with the lawsuit will likely be significantly higher than if a lawsuit were not required, and you may be responsible for paying those costs and attorney fees.  If you want to make this demand, you must state in writing that 'I demand a judicial foreclosure proceeding upon my unit,' or words substantially to that effect.  You must send this written demand by first class and certified U.S. mail, return receipt requested, within 30 days after the day on which this notice was delivered to you.  The address to which you must mail your demand is (insert the address of the association of unit owners for receipt of a demand)."; and</td>
