Each unit owner shall be entitled to an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities in the percentages or fractions expressed in the declaration.  The declaration may allocate to each unit an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities proportionate to either the size or par value of the unit.  Otherwise, the declaration shall allocate to each unit an equal undivided interest in the common areas and facilities, subject to the following exception: each convertible space depicted on the condominium plat shall be allocated an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities proportionate to the size of the space vis-a-vis the aggregate size of all units so depicted, while the remaining undivided interest in the common areas and facilities shall be allocated equally among the other units so depicted.  The undivided interest in the common areas and facilities allocated in accordance with this Subsection <a href="#57-8-7(2)">(2)</a> shall add up to one if stated as fractions or to 100% if stated as percentages.  If an equal undivided interest in the common areas and facilities is allocated to each unit, the declaration may simply state that fact and need not express the fraction or percentage so allocated.  Otherwise, the undivided interest allocated to each unit shall be reflected by a table in the declaration, or by an exhibit or schedule accompanying the declaration and recorded simultaneously with it, containing columns.  The first column shall identify the units, listing them serially or grouping them together in the case of units to which identical undivided interests are allocated.  Corresponding figures in the second and third columns shall set forth the respective sizes or par values of those units and the fraction or percentage of undivided interest in the common areas and facilities allocated thereto.</td>
