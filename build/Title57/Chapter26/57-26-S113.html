This chapter does not limit the standing or right of a tenant to request a court to appoint a receiver for the real property subject to the assignment or to seek other relief on the ground that the assignee's nonpayment of expenses of protecting or maintaining the real property has caused or threatened harm to the tenant's interest in the property.  Whether the tenant is entitled to the appointment of a receiver or other relief is governed by law of this state other than this chapter.</td>
