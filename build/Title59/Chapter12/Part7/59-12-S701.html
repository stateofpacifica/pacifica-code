          </b><b>Purpose statement.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Utah Legislature finds and declares that:<a id="59-12-701(1)" name="59-12-701(1)"></a>

<table width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td style="vertical-align:text-top">(4)</td><td style="width:99%">
The state's support of its recreational and zoological facilities and its botanical, cultural, and zoological organizations has not been sufficient to assure the continuing existence and growth of these facilities and organizations, and the Legislature believes that local government may wish to play a greater role in the support of these organizations.</td>

<td style="vertical-align:text-top">(5)</td><td style="width:99%">
Without jeopardizing the state's ongoing support of its recreational and zoological facilities and its botanical, cultural, and zoological organizations, the Legislature intends to permit the counties of the state of Utah to enhance public financial support of Utah's publicly owned or operated recreational and zoological facilities, and botanical, cultural, and zoological organizations owned or operated by institutions or private nonprofit organizations, through the imposition of a county sales and use tax.</td>

<table width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td style="vertical-align:text-top">(6)</td><td style="width:99%">
In a county of the first class, it is necessary and appropriate to allocate a tax imposed under this part in a manner that provides adequate predictable support to a fixed number of botanical and cultural organizations and that gives the county legislative body discretion to allocate the tax revenues to other botanical and cultural organizations.</td>
