"Administrative and claims expense" includes all claims paid, agency expenses, third party administrator expenses, taxes, licenses, fees, loss adjustment expenses, legal expenses, reinsurance premiums, and all other expenses incurred directly in connection with the insurance of Utah risks by the insurer, less any recoveries or reimbursements collected or collectible because of reinsurance or any other source, but only with respect to Utah risks.  The administrative and claims expense also includes the pro rata portion attributable to Utah risks of the salaries and fringe benefits, including taxes on salaries, of all personnel responsible for the administration of the insurer, the printing and stationery, and all other expenses attributable to the administration of the insurer.  When personnel are engaged in the administration of the insurer as only part of their employment, for purposes of this section their salaries and fringe benefits shall be prorated based on the portion of their time devoted to the administration of the insurer.  Appropriate overhead charges shall be included with all the expenses listed in this subsection.</td>
