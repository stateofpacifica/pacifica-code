Except as provided in Subsection <a href="#59-5-203(3)">(3)</a>, the basis for computing the gross proceeds, prior to those deductions or adjustments specified in this chapter, in determining the taxable value of the metals or metalliferous minerals sold or otherwise disposed of, in the order of priority, is as follows:

If the metals or metalliferous mineral products are actually sold, the value of those metals or metalliferous mineral products shall be the gross amount the producer receives from that sale, provided that the metals or metalliferous mineral products are sold under a bona fide contract of sale between unaffiliated parties.  In the case of a sale of uranium concentrates, gross proceeds shall be the gross amount the producer receives from the sale of processed uranium concentrate or "yellowcake," provided that the uranium concentrate is sold under a bona fide contract of sale between unaffiliated parties.</td>

If the metals or metalliferous mineral products are not actually sold but are shipped, transported, or delivered out of state, the gross proceeds shall be the multiple of the recoverable units of finished metals, or of the finished metals contained in the metalliferous minerals shipped, and the average daily price per unit of contained metals as quoted by an established authority for market prices of metals for the period during which the tax imposed by this chapter is due.  The established authority or authorities shall be designated by the commission by rule adopted in accordance with <a href="../../Title63G/Chapter3/63G-3.html?v=C63G-3_1800010118000101">Title 63G, Chapter 3, Utah Administrative Rulemaking Act</a>.</td>

In the case of metals or metalliferous minerals not sold, but otherwise disposed of, for which there is no established authority for market prices of metals for the period during which the tax imposed by this chapter is due, gross proceeds is determined by allocating to the state the same proportion of the producer's total sales of metals or metalliferous minerals sold or otherwise disposed of as the producer's total Utah costs bear to the total costs associated with sale or disposal of the metal or metalliferous mineral.</td>
