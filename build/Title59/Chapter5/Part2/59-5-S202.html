If the metals or metalliferous minerals are shipped outside the state, this constitutes a sale, and the finished metals or the recoverable units of finished metals from the metalliferous minerals shipped are subject to the severance tax.  If the metals or metalliferous minerals are stockpiled, the tax is not applicable until they are sold or shipped out of state.  For purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter, uranium concentrates shall be considered to be finished metals.  The owner of the metals or metalliferous minerals that are stockpiled shall report to the commission annually, in a form acceptable to the commission, the amount of metalliferous minerals so stockpiled.  Metals or metalliferous minerals that are stockpiled for more than two years, however, are subject to the severance tax.</td>
