The commission, in order to ensure the payment and collection of an ad valorem property tax imposed against uranium and vanadium mining properties, may require the owner or the person engaged in mining the properties to deposit a security with the commission in an amount determined by the commission.  The security shall be deposited with the commission within 30 days of proper notice by the commission that the security is required.  Notice by registered mail to the last-known address as shown in the records of the commission constitutes proper notice.</td>

The security may be sold by the commission at public sale in order to recover any tax, interest, or penalty due.  Notice of the sale may be personally served upon the person who deposited the securities, or served by registered mail sent to the last-known address as shown in the records of the commission.

The ad valorem tax imposed upon metalliferous mining claims and properties is a personal obligation of the owner or operator of the affected claims or properties, and the obligations are not satisfied until paid in full.  If a mining claim or property is sold at the tax sale under <a href="../../Title59/Chapter2/59-2-P13.html?v=C59-2-P13_1800010118000101">Part 13, Collection of Taxes</a>, the sale does not extinguish the personal obligation of the owner or operator of the claim or property.  The personal obligation continues to exist against the owner or operator of the claim or property until paid or otherwise satisfied. Other real or personal property of the owner or operator may be seized or sold to satisfy the personal obligation.  This remedy is not exclusive but is in addition to any other remedy provided by law for the collection of these taxes.  Nothing contained in this section abrogates existing powers of the commission or a county legislative body to compromise or adjust the assessment of taxes.</td>
