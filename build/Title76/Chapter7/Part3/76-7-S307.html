<b>76-7-307.&nbsp;
          </b><b>Medical procedure required to save life of unborn child.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an abortion is performed when the unborn child is sufficiently developed to have any reasonable possibility of survival outside its mother's womb, the medical procedure used must be that which, in the best medical judgment of the physician will give the unborn child the best chance of survival.  No medical procedure designed to kill or injure that unborn child may be used unless necessary, in the opinion of the woman's physician, to prevent grave damage to her medical health.
