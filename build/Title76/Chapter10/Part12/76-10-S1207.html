If a tenant or occupant of real property uses this property for an activity for which he or his employee is convicted under any provision of this part, the conviction makes void the lease or other title under which he holds at the option of the fee owner or any intermediate lessor; and 10 days after the fee owner or any intermediate lessor gives notice in writing to the tenant or occupant that he is exercising the option, the right of possession to the property reverts in the person exercising the option. This option does not arise until all avenues of direct appeal from the conviction have been exhausted or abandoned by the tenant or occupant, or his employee.</td>
