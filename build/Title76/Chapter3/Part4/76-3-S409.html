Any person convicted in the district court of child abuse, or a sexual offense if the victim is under 18 years of age, may be ordered to participate in treatment or therapy under the supervision of the adult probation and parole section of the Department of Corrections, in cooperation with the division of children, youth, and families until the court is satisfied that such treatment or therapy has been successful or that no further benefit to the convicted offender would result if such treatment or therapy were continued.  The court may also order treatment of the victim if it believes the same would be beneficial under the circumstances.  Nothing in this section shall preclude the court from imposing any additional sentence as provided by law.</td>
