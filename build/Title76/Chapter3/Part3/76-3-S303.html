When an executive or high managerial officer of a corporation or association is convicted of an offense committed in furtherance of the affairs of the corporation or association, the court may include in the sentence an order disqualifying him from exercising similar functions in the same or other corporations or associations for a period of not exceeding five years if it finds the scope or willfulness of his illegal actions make it dangerous or inadvisable for such functions to be entrusted to him.</td>
