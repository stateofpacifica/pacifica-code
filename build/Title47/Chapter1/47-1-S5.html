          </b><b>Order of abatement -- Execution -- Sale of personal property -- Padlocking.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the existence of the nuisance is established in an action as provided in this chapter, an order of abatement shall be entered as a part of the judgment in the case. The order shall direct the removal from the building or place of all fixtures, furniture, musical instruments, and movable property used in conducting the nuisance, and shall direct the sale thereof in the manner provided for the sale of chattels under execution, and shall further direct the effective closing of the building or place against its use for any purpose, and the keeping of it so closed for a period of one year, unless sooner released. If any person shall break and enter or use a building, structure, or place so directed to be closed, he shall be punished as for contempt as provided in Section <a href="../../Title47/Chapter1/47-1-S4.html?v=C47-1-S4_1800010118000101">47-1-4</a>. For removing and selling the movable property the officer shall be entitled to charge and receive the same fees as for levying upon and selling like property on execution; and for closing the premises and keeping them closed a reasonable sum shall be allowed by the court.
