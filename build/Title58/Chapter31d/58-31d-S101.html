          </b><b>Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact.</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact is hereby enacted and entered into with all other jurisdictions that legally join in the compact, which is, in form, substantially as follows:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE I<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Findings and Declaration of Purpose<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  
The party states find that:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  the health and safety of the public are affected by the degree of compliance with APRN licensure requirements and the effectiveness of enforcement activities related to State APRN licensure laws;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  
violations of APRN licensure and other laws regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  
the expanded mobility of APRNs and the use of advanced communication and intervention technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)  
new practice modalities and technology make compliance with individual state APRN licensure laws difficult and complex;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)  
the current system of duplicative APRN licensure for APRNs practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for healthcare delivery systems, payors, state licensing boards, regulators and APRNs; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)  
uniformity of APRN licensure requirements throughout the states promotes public safety and public health benefits as well as providing a mechanism to increase access to care, particularly in rural and underserved areas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  
The general purposes of this compact are to:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  facilitate the states' responsibilities to protect the public's health and safety;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  
ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of APRN licensure and regulation, including promotion of uniform licensure requirements;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  
facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the areas of APRN regulation, investigation, and adverse actions;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)  
promote compliance with the laws governing APRN practice in each jurisdiction;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)  
invest all party states with the authority to hold an APRN accountable for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state privileges to practice;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)  
decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of APRN licenses; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)  
provide opportunities for interstate practice by APRNs who meet uniform licensure requirements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE II<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As used in this compact:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) "Advanced practice registered nurse" or "APRN" means a registered nurse who has gained additional specialized knowledge, skills, and experience through a program of study recognized or defined by the Interstate Commission of APRN Compact Administrators ("Commission") and who is licensed to perform advanced nursing practice.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  investigative information that a licensing board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the APRN to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)

An APRN multistate license issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing the APRN to practice as an APRN in each party state, under a multistate licensure privilege, in the same role and population focus as the APRN is licensed in the home state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)  
Nothing in this Compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license, except that an individual may apply for a single-state license, instead of a multistate license, even if otherwise qualified for the multistate license. However, the failure of such an individual to affirmatively opt for a single state license may result in the issuance of a multistate license.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)  
Issuance of an APRN multistate license shall include prescriptive authority for non-controlled prescription drugs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)  
For each state in which an APRN seeks authority to prescribe controlled substances, the APRN shall satisfy all requirements imposed by such state in granting and/or renewing such authority.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) (a)  
An APRN issued a multistate license is authorized to assume responsibility and accountability for patient care independent of any supervisory or collaborative relationship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)

APRN practice in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will subject the APRN to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)  
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Compact, this Compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state shall be recognized by other party states as satisfying any state law requirement for registered nurse licensure as a precondition for authorization to practice as an APRN in that state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12)  
Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state APRN license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as an APRN in any other party state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE IV<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applications for APRN Licensure in a Party State<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Upon application for an APRN multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder of a licensed practical/vocational nursing license, a registered nursing license or an advanced practice registered nursing license issued by another state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against a license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) An APRN may hold a multistate APRN license issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) If an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the APRN must apply for APRN licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state shall be deactivated in accordance with applicable Commission rules.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The APRN may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) A multistate APRN license shall not be issued by the new home state until the APRN provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate APRN license from the new home state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) When an APRN changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a non-party state, the APRN multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE V<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board shall have the authority to:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Take adverse action against an APRN's multistate licensure privilege to practice within that party state.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)  Only the home state shall have the power to impose adverse action against the APRN license issued by the home state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)  
For purposes of imposing adverse action, the home state licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct that occurred outside the home state as it would if that conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, it shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on an APRN's authority to practice within that party state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)  
Complete any pending investigations of an APRN who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)  
Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence in accordance with the following:(i)  
Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and/or the production of evidence from another party state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the court's practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)  
The issuing licensing board shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses and/or evidence are located;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)  
Obtain and submit, for an APRN licensure applicant, fingerprints or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for criminal background checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure decision.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)  
If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected APRN the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that APRN.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)  
Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) (a)  
If adverse action is taken by a home state against an APRN's multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states under a multistate licensure privilege shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the APRN's multistate license.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  
All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an APRN's multistate license shall include a statement that the APRN's multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) (a)  
Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  
The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any APRN for the duration of the APRN's participation in an alternative program.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARTICLE VI<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information system of all APRNs, licensed registered nurses and licensed practical/vocational nurses. This system will include information on the licensure and disciplinary history of each APRN, as submitted by party states, to assist in the coordinated administration of APRN licensure enforcement efforts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  
The Commission, in consultation with the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system, shall formulate necessary and proper procedures for the identification, collection and exchange of information under this Compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)  
All licensing boards shall promptly report to the coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, any current significant investigative information, denials of applications (reason for such denials) and APRN participation in alternative programs known to the licensing board regardless of whether such participation is deemed nonpublic and/or confidential under state law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)  
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party states' licensing boards contributing information to the coordinated licensure information system may designate information that may not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express permission of the contributing state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)  
Any personally identifiable information obtained from the coordinated licensure information system by a party state licensing board shall not be shared with non-party states or disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing the information.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)  
Any information contributed to the coordinated licensure information system that is subsequently required to be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that information shall also be expunged from the coordinated licensure information system.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7)  
The Compact administrator of each party state shall furnish a uniform data set to the Compact administrator of each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) identifying information;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) licensure data;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
