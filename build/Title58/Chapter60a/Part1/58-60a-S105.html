The Licensed Professional Counselor shall pay all applicable fees to the new Home State in order to be issued a new Home State license.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. If a Licensed Professional Counselor changes Primary State of Residence by moving from Member State to a non-Member State, or from a non-Member State to a Member State, the State criteria shall apply for issuance of a Single State License in the new State.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Nothing in this Compact shall interfere with a Licensee's ability to hold a Single State License in multiple States, however for the purposes of this Compact, a Licensee shall have only one Home State license.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. Nothing in this Compact shall affect the requirements established by a Member State for the issuance of a Single State License.<br>
