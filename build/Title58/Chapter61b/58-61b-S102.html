<br>
<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">PURPOSE</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, states license psychologists, in order to protect the public through verification of education, training, and experience and ensure accountability for professional practice;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the day to day practice of telepsychology (i.e. the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies) by psychologists across state boundaries in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, this Compact is intended to regulate the temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology by psychologists across state boundaries for 30 days within a calendar year in the performance of their psychological practice as assigned by an appropriate authority;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, this Compact is intended to authorize State Psychology Regulatory Authorities to afford legal recognition, in a manner consistent with the terms of the Compact, to psychologists licensed in another state;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, this Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of psychologists and that such state regulation will best protect public health and safety;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, this Compact does not apply when a psychologist is licensed in both the Home and Receiving States; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, this Compact does not apply to permanent in-person, face-to-face practice, it does allow for authorization of temporary psychological practice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consistent with these principles, this Compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Increase public access to professional psychological services by allowing for telepsychological practice across state lines as well as temporary in-person, face-to-face services into a state in which the psychologist is not licensed to practice psychology;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially client/patient safety;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Encourage the cooperation of Compact States in the areas of psychology licensure and regulation;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Facilitate the exchange of information between Compact States regarding psychologist licensure, adverse actions, and disciplinary history;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  Promote compliance with the laws governing psychological practice in each Compact State; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.  Invest all Compact States with the authority to hold licensed psychologists accountable through the mutual recognition of Compact State licenses.<br>

Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  Membership, voting, and meetings<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The Commission shall consist of one voting representative appointed by each Compact State who shall serve as that state's Commissioner.

Each Commissioner shall be entitled to one (1) vote with regard to the promulgation of Rules and creation of Bylaws and shall otherwise have an opportunity to participate in the business and affairs of the Commission.

The Bylaws may provide for Commissioners' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of communication.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  The Commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year. Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the Bylaws.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  All meetings shall be open to the public, and public notice of meetings shall be given in the same manner as required under the rulemaking provisions in Article XI.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.

Non-compliance of a Compact State with its obligations under the Compact;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  The employment, compensation, discipline or other personnel matters, practices or procedures related to specific employees, or other matters related to the Commission's internal personnel practices and procedures;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.

Matters specifically exempted from disclosure by federal and state statute.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.  If a meeting, or portion of a meeting, is closed pursuant to this provision, the Commission's legal counsel or designee shall certify that the meeting may be closed and shall reference each relevant exempting provision. The Commission shall keep minutes which fully and clearly describe all matters discussed in a meeting and shall provide a full and accurate summary of actions taken, of any person participating in the meeting, and the reasons therefore, including a description of the views expressed. All documents considered in connection with an action shall be identified in such minutes. All minutes and documents of a closed meeting shall remain under seal, subject to release only by a majority vote of the Commission or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  The Commission shall, by a majority vote of the Commissioners, prescribe Bylaws and/or Rules to govern its conduct as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes and exercise the powers of the Compact, including but not limited to:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

Establishing the titles, duties and authority, and reasonable procedures for the election of the officers of the Commission;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.

The Commission shall pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses of its establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The Commission may accept any and all appropriate revenue sources and donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  The Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each Compact State or impose fees on other parties to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover its annual budget as approved each year for which revenue is not provided by other sources. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Commission which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all Compact States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.

<br>
<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">RULEMAKING</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Article and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  If a majority of the legislatures of the Compact States rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any Compact State.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  Rules or amendments to the Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or Rules by the Commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  On the website of the Commission; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  On the website of each Compact States' Psychology Regulatory Authority or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.  The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.  Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G.  The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  At least twenty-five (25) persons who submit comments independently of each other;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  A governmental subdivision or agency; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  A duly appointed person in an association that has at least twenty-five (25) members.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H.  If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the Commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the Executive Director of the Commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing not less than five (5) business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  No transcript of the hearing is required, unless a written request for a transcript is made, in which case the person requesting the transcript shall bear the cost of producing the transcript. A recording may be made in lieu of a transcript under the same terms and conditions as a transcript. This subsection shall not preclude the Commission from making a transcript or recording of the hearing if it so chooses.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J.  The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K.  If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a public hearing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Prevent a loss of Commission or Compact State funds;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by federal law or rule; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Protect public health and safety.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M.  The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the Chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.<br>

<br>
<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Oversight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of state government in each Compact State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of this Compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Compact State pertaining to the subject matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  If the Commission determines that a Compact State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other Compact States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of remedying the default, and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the Compact States, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated on the effective date of termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be submitted by the Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the Compact States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  A Compact State which has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations which extend beyond the effective date of termination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to be in default or which has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  Dispute Resolution<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Upon request by a Compact State, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact which arise among Compact States and between Compact and Non-Compact States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes that arise before the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.  Enforcement<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the U.S. District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the Compact has its principal offices against a Compact State in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules and Bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.<br>

Any rule which has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  Any Compact State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  A Compact State's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing State's Psychology Regulatory Authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.  Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a Compact State and a Non-Compact State which does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.  This Compact may be amended by the Compact States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Compact State until it is enacted into the law of all Compact States.<br>
