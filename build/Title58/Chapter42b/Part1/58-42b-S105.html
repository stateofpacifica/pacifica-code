<br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)  
An Occupational Therapist or Occupational Therapy Assistant may hold a Home State license, which allows for Compact Privileges in Member States, in only one Member State at a time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)  
If an Occupational Therapist or Occupational Therapy Assistant changes Primary State of Residence by moving between two Member States:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)  The Occupational Therapist or Occupational Therapy Assistant shall file an application for obtaining a new Home State license by virtue of a Compact Privilege, pay all applicable fees, and notify the current and new Home State in accordance with applicable Rules adopted by the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)  
Upon receipt of an application for obtaining a new Home State license by virtue of Compact Privilege, the new Home State shall verify that the Occupational Therapist or Occupational Therapy Assistant meets the pertinent criteria outlined in Section <a href="../../Title58/Chapter42B/58-42b-S104.html?v=C58-42b-S104_2022050420220504">58-42b-104</a> via the Data System, without need for primary source verification except for:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)  an FBI fingerprint based criminal background check if not previously performed or updated pursuant to applicable Rules adopted by the Commission in accordance with Public Law 92-544;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)  
other criminal background check as required by the new Home State; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) 
submission of any requisite Jurisprudence Requirements of the new Home State.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)  
The former Home State shall convert the former Home State license into a Compact Privilege once the new Home State has activated the new Home State license in accordance with applicable Rules adopted by the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)  
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Compact, if the Occupational Therapist or Occupational Therapy Assistant cannot meet the criteria in Section <a href="../../Title58/Chapter42B/58-42b-S104.html?v=C58-42b-S104_2022050420220504">58-42b-104</a>, the new Home State shall apply its requirements for issuing a new Single-State License.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)  
The Occupational Therapist or the Occupational Therapy Assistant shall pay all applicable fees to the new Home State in order to be issued a new Home State license.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C)  
If an Occupational Therapist or Occupational Therapy Assistant changes Primary State of Residence by moving from a Member State to a non-Member State, or from a non-Member State to a Member State, the State criteria shall apply for issuance of a Single-State License in the new State.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D)  
Nothing in this compact shall interfere with a Licensee's ability to hold a Single-State License in multiple States; however, for the purposes of this compact, a Licensee shall have only one Home State license.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E)  
Nothing in this Compact shall affect the requirements established by a Member State for the issuance of a Single-State License.<br>
