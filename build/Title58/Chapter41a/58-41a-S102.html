ADVERSE ACTIONS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a remote state shall have the authority, in accordance with existing state due process law, to:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Take adverse action against an audiologist's or speech-language pathologist's privilege to practice within that member state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well as the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses or evidence are located.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.

Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote state, provided that the home state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse action against an audiologist's or speech-language pathologist's license issued by the home state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had occurred within the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to determine appropriate action.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. The home state shall complete any pending investigations of an audiologist or speech-language pathologist who changes primary state of residence during the course of the investigations. The home state shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly report the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the new home state of any adverse actions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. Joint Investigations<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In addition to the authority granted to a member state by its respective audiology or speech-language pathology practice act or other applicable state law, any member state may participate with other member states in joint investigations of licensees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Member states shall share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the Compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F. If adverse action is taken by the home state against an audiologist's or speech language pathologist's license, the audiologist's or speech-language pathologist's privilege to practice in all other member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the state license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an audiologist's or speech language pathologist's license shall include a statement that the audiologist's or speech-language pathologist's privilege to practice is deactivated in all member states during the pendency of the order.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G. If a member state takes adverse action against a license, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home state and any remote states in which the licensee has the practice privilege of any adverse actions by the home state or remote states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H.

Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule shall be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.

All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the recording shall be made available to any person upon request and at the requesting person's expense.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.

Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J. If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a public hearing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule.

Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision shall take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 11. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Dispute Resolution<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Enforcement<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 12. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR AUDIOLOGY AND SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact statute is enacted into law in the 10th member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the Compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Any state that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's audiology or speech-language pathology licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any audiology or speech-language pathology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. This Compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any member state, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 14. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the Compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. All laws in a member state in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. All lawful actions of the Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the member states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. All agreements between the Commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. In the event any provision of the Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the Legislature of any member state, the provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.<br>
