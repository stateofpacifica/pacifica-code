The board may purchase obligations from lenders or make loans to eligible borrowers, out of money available to the board for loans.  The board shall promulgate rules for determining the needs of the respective borrowers for loans and for the purpose of making loans or purchasing obligations.  The amount of an obligation purchased by the board or of a loan made by the board to an eligible borrower, whether enrolled or to be enrolled in a private institution or a tax-supported public institution, is determined by the board upon the basis of substantially similar standards and guides set forth in the board's rules.  The board, in determining the needs of eligible borrowers for guaranteed loans, may consider the amount of assistance available to the students.</td>
