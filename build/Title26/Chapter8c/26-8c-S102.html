<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">SECTION 1.  PURPOSE</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to protect the public through verification of competency and ensure accountability for patient care related activities all states license emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, such as emergency medical technicians (EMTs), advanced EMTs and paramedics.  This Compact is intended to facilitate the day to day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate authority and authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal recognition to EMS personnel licensed in a member state.  This Compact recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public's health and safety through their licensing and regulation of EMS personnel and that such state regulation shared among the member states will best protect public health and safety.  This Compact is designed to achieve the following purposes and objectives:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Increase public access to EMS personnel;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Enhance the states' ability to protect the public's health and safety, especially patient safety;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.

Support licensing of military members who are separating from an active duty tour and their spouses;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  Facilitate the exchange of information between member states regarding EMS personnel licensure, adverse action and significant investigatory information;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.  Promote compliance with the laws governing EMS personnel practice in each member state; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.  Invest all member states with the authority to hold EMS personnel accountable through the mutual recognition of member state licenses.<br>

<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">SECTION 12.  RULEMAKING</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  The Commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this Section and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any member state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.  Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the Commission, and at least sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  On the website of the Commission; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  On the website of each member state EMS authority or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.  The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the Commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.  Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the Commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G.  The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  At least twenty-five (25) persons;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  A governmental subdivision or agency; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  An association having at least twenty-five (25) members.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H.  If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the Commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the executive director of the Commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing not less than five (5) business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  No transcript of the hearing is required, unless a written request for a transcript is made, in which case the person requesting the transcript shall bear the cost of producing the transcript.  A recording may be made in lieu of a transcript under the same terms and conditions as a transcript.  This subsection shall not preclude the Commission from making a transcript or recording of the hearing if it so chooses.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.  Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this section.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I.  Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;J.  The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K.  If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a public hearing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;L.  Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Prevent a loss of Commission or member state funds;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by federal law or rule; or<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Protect public health and safety.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M.  The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors.  Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission.  The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting.  The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.  A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period.  If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action.  If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission.<br>
<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">SECTION 13.  OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  Oversight<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.  The provisions of this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the Commission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  If the Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the Commission shall:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.  Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.  Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.  The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by petitioning the U.S.  District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  Dispute Resolution<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  Upon request by a member state, the Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member states.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.  Enforcement<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Commission.  The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.  The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the tenth member state.  The provisions, which become effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules.  Thereafter, the Commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.  Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the Commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.  Any member state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing statute.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's EMS authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.  Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any EMS personnel licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.  This Compact may be amended by the member states.  No amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into the laws of all member states.<br>
<div style="text-align:center; width:100%; display:inline-block">SECTION 15.  CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY</div>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states.  Nothing in this compact supersedes state law or rules related to licensure of EMS agencies.<br>
