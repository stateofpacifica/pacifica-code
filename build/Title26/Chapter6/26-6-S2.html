"Carrier" means an infected individual or animal who harbors a specific infectious agent in the absence of discernible clinical disease and serves as a potential source of infection for man.  The carrier state may occur in an individual with an infection that is inapparent throughout its course, commonly known as healthy or asymptomatic carrier, or during the incubation period, convalescence, and postconvalescence of an individual with a clinically recognizable disease, commonly known as incubatory carrier or convalescent carrier.  Under either circumstance the carrier state may be of short duration, as a temporary or transient carrier, or long duration, as a chronic carrier.</td>
