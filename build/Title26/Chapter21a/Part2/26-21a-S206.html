Dense breast tissue is common and is found in as many as half of all women. However, dense breast tissue can make it more difficult to fully and accurately evaluate your mammogram and detect early signs of possible cancer in the breast. This information is being provided to inform and encourage you to discuss your dense breast tissue and other breast cancer risk factors with your health care provider. Together, you can decide what may be best for you. A copy of your mammography report has been sent to your health care provider. Please contact them if you have any questions or concerns about this notice." </td>
